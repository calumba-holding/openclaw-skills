  End-to-end GitCode issue workflow covering issue pickup, analysis, code modification, and PR submission.
  Use when user asks to handle/fix/resolve a GitCode issue, or when working on issue-driven development
  for GitCode repositories. Triggers on phrases like "接取 issue", "处理 issue", "修复 issue", "fix issue",
  "handle issue", "resolve issue", "提交 PR", "create PR for issue". Requires gitcode CLI (GitCode CLI) and git.
  NOT for code review (use code-review skill), issue triage without code changes, or non-GitCode platforms.

# GitCode Issue Workflow

End-to-end workflow: Issue → Analysis → Code Fix → PR Submission.

## Prerequisites

- **gitcode CLI**: GitCode CLI (similar to GitHub's `gh`). Source: https://github.com/codeasier/gitcode-cli
- **git**: Standard git CLI
- **GitCode Token**: Stored in MEMORY.md or provided by user
- **Local repo**: User must confirm the local repository path

**CLI command name:**
- `gitcode` — full command name, works on all platforms (recommended on Windows)
- `gc` — short alias, works on macOS/Linux (conflicts with PowerShell `Get-Content` on Windows)

**gitcode CLI detection (follow this order):**
1. Try `gitcode --version` first (recommended, works everywhere)
2. If not found, try `gc --version` (macOS/Linux fallback)
3. If neither found, ask user for the full path to the executable
4. If not installed, prompt to install from https://github.com/codeasier/gitcode-cli

**gitcode CLI authentication check:**
After confirming the CLI is installed, try a lightweight command to verify authentication (e.g., `gitcode issue view 1 --repo <owner>/<repo>`). If it returns a token-related error like `Invalid header parameter: private-token, required`, the CLI is not authenticated.

**Stop and prompt the user to authenticate first**:
```bash
gitcode auth login
```
Or if they have a token, use `--with-token` (not `--token`):
```bash
echo <your_token> | gitcode auth login --with-token
```

**Windows note:** If the CLI outputs emoji characters and throws `UnicodeEncodeError: 'gbk' codec can't encode character`, set the Python IO encoding before running CLI commands:
```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
gitcode issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

Do not proceed with the workflow until authentication is successful.

**Windows note:** On PowerShell, `gc` is an alias for `Get-Content`. Always use `gitcode` on Windows.

## 6-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch & Read Issue

Fetch the issue using gitcode CLI:

```bash
gitcode issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo>
gitcode issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comments
```

(`gc` can be used as shorthand on macOS/Linux, e.g., `gc issue view ...`)

**If the CLI returns an authentication error** (e.g., `Invalid header parameter: private-token, required`):
1. Check `gitcode auth status`
2. If not authenticated, **prompt the user to run `gitcode auth login`** and stop the workflow
3. If the user prefers not to use the CLI for authentication, fall back to the GitCode API with an explicit token:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.gitcode.com/api/v5/repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>?access_token=<token>"
   curl -s "https://api.gitcode.com/api/v5/repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments?access_token=<token>"
   ```

Parse and present to user:
- Issue title, state, author, assignees, labels
- Problem description (each numbered point)
- Comments from maintainers (especially assignment decisions and clarifications)

### Step 2: Confirm Local Repository

**Must confirm with user before proceeding:**

1. Ask user for the local repository path (or confirm if already known)
2. Verify the repo exists and is on the correct branch:

```bash
cd <repo_path>
git status
git log --oneline -3
```

3. Pull latest code from the target branch (usually `master`):

```bash
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

**⚠️ Constraints:**
- Never assume the local repo path — always confirm with user
- Verify working tree is clean before starting work
- Identify which remote is `upstream` (the target org repo) vs personal fork

### Step 3: Read & Analyze Target Files

Read the files that need modification based on the issue description:

```bash
# Use read tool to examine the file contents
read <file_path>
```

**Analysis requirements:**
- Understand the current structure and content of files to be modified
- Cross-reference with issue requirements and maintainer comments
- Identify the minimal change set needed

### Step 4: Propose Changes

**⚠️ Must get user approval before modifying any files.**

Present to the user:
1. **Modification target**: Which file(s) will be changed
2. **Modification approach**: What will be changed and why
3. **Expected diff**: Show the before/after comparison in diff format

```diff
- old content
+ new content
```

4. **Rationale**: How this addresses the issue requirements

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 5.**

If user requests adjustments, revise the proposal and re-present.

### Step 5: Apply Changes

After user approval, apply the changes:

```bash
# Edit the file using edit tool
edit <file_path> oldText -> newText
```

Verify the changes:

```bash
cd <repo_path>
git diff <file>
```

Show the diff output to user for final confirmation.

### Step 6: Create Branch, Commit & Submit PR

This step involves multiple sub-steps. Follow them in strict order.

#### 6.1 Create Branch

Branch naming format: `[type]_[YYYYMMDD]_[brief_description]`

- **type**: `doc`, `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
- **date**: Current date in YYYYMMDD format
- **description**: 1-2 English words separated by underscores

```bash
cd <repo_path>
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Examples:
- `doc_20260424_contributing_guide`
- `fix_20260424_null_check`
- `feat_20260424_export_csv`

#### 6.2 Commit

Commit message format: `[type]([module]): [detailed description]`

```bash
git add <changed_files>
git commit -m "<type>(<module>): <description>"
```

Examples:
- `docs(readme): elevate contributing guide to standalone section`
- `fix(parser): add null check for empty input`
- `feat(export): add CSV export support`

#### 6.3 Push to Personal Fork

**⚠️ Critical constraints:**
- **Must ask user which remote to push to** — never assume
- **Never push directly to the upstream/organization repository**
- List available remotes for user to choose:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Then push:

```bash
git push <personal_remote> <branch_name>
```

#### 6.4 Create PR (Merge Request)

**Method 1: gitcode CLI (preferred)**

```bash
gitcode pr create -R <upstream_owner>/<repo> \
  --fork <personal_owner>/<repo> \
  --head <branch_name> \
  --base <target_branch> \
  --title "<commit_message>" \
  --body "<pr_description>"
```

On macOS/Linux, `gc` is a valid shorthand: `gc pr create ...`

**⚠️ Must ask user for the target branch** (e.g., `master`, `main`, `develop`) if not already known. Do not assume.

```

**Method 2: GitCode API (fallback if gc CLI fails)**

See [references/gitcode-api.md](references/gitcode-api.md) for the API endpoint and parameters.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.gitcode.com/api/v5/repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls?access_token=<token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @<payload_file>
```

Payload structure:

```json
{
  "title": "<PR title>",
  "body": "<PR description>",
  "head": "<fork_owner>:<branch_name>",
  "base": "<target_branch>",
  "fork_path": "<fork_owner>/<repo>"
}
```

**Method 3: Manual (last resort)**

If both gc CLI and API fail, provide the user with the manual creation URL:

```
https://gitcode.com/<fork_owner>/<repo>/merge_requests/new?source_branch=<branch_name>
```

And the PR description text for them to paste.

#### 6.5 Confirm & Report

After PR creation, present a summary:

| Item | Value |
|:---|:---|
| PR URL | `<link>` |
| PR Number | `#<number>` |
| Source | `<fork_owner>/<repo>:<branch>` |
| Target | `<upstream_owner>/<repo>:<base_branch>` |
| Linked Issue | `#<issue_number>` |
| Status | Opened |

## Key Constraints

### Safety Rules

1. **Never push to upstream/organization repos directly** — always use personal fork
2. **Never modify files without user approval** — always show proposed changes first
3. **Never assume repository paths** — always confirm with user
4. **Never assume target branch** — always ask if unknown
5. **Never assume push remote** — always list remotes and ask user to choose
6. **All external write operations require explicit user confirmation**

### Git Workflow Rules

1. Working tree must be clean before creating a new branch
2. Branch must be created from the latest target branch code
3. Commit messages must follow the format: `[type]([module]): [description]`
4. Branch names must follow the format: `[type]_[YYYYMMDD]_[brief_description]`
5. Always verify changes with `git diff` before committing

### Asking vs Doing

| Action | Ask First? |
|:---|:---|
| Read files, check git status | ❌ Just do it |
| Fetch issue details | ❌ Just do it |
| Propose changes | ❌ Present proposal |
| Modify files | ✅ Wait for approval |
| Push to remote | ✅ Ask which remote |
| Create PR | ✅ Ask target branch if unknown |
| Post issue comments | ✅ Always confirm |

## Temp File Management

All temporary files generated during the workflow must be stored in `temp/` directory under the workspace:

```
workspace/temp/
├── *.md          # Downloaded files for review
├── *.json        # API payloads
└── *             # Other temp files
```

**⚠️ Clean up `temp/` directory after workflow completion:**

```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force temp/  # Windows
rm -rf temp/                        # Linux/macOS
```
