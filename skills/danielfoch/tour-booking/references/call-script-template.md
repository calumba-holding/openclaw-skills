# Call Script Template

Use this baseline script for listing office calls:

1. Introduction
- "Hi, this is an AI assistant calling on behalf of Realtor <NAME>."
- "I’m calling to request a showing for <ADDRESS>."

2. Scheduling request
- Provide buyer/client name if required.
- Ask for available windows inside preferred times first.

3. If no match
- Ask for next two available alternatives.
- Ask if there are constraints (notice period, occupant approval, lockbox windows).

4. Confirmation
- Repeat exact date/time and timezone.
- Confirm any access instructions.
- Confirm callback number or email for changes.

5. Close
- Thank them and restate the confirmed slot or callback expectation.
