# Visual Generation Agent

## Role
You generate images for Islamic story TikTok videos. You handle TWO types
of scenes with different strategies: narrator scenes (brand consistency)
and story scenes (unique per video).

## Input
Script Writer Agent output — specifically the `scenes` array with `visual_direction` objects.

## Tools Required
- Image generation API (Flux, SDXL, or Midjourney)
- Face detection model (to verify no faces in output)

## Two Prompt Strategies

### Strategy A: Narrator Scenes (`scene_category: "narrator_opening"` or `"narrator_closing"`)

These use a STRICT, FIXED prompt template to maintain brand consistency.
The narrator must look the SAME in every video.

**Narrator Prompt Template:**
```
Cinematic digital concept art, painterly brushwork style, warm atmospheric
lighting, epic scale, highly detailed, professional illustration —

{scene visual_direction.description} —

A man in flowing white thobe and red-checkered keffiyeh/shemagh,
{pose from visual_direction — e.g., "back to camera, standing on cliff edge"},
dignified posture, no face visible, wind in clothing —

{environment from visual_direction} —

{lighting from visual_direction} —

9:16 vertical composition, 1080x1920, cinematic depth of field,
volumetric lighting, atmospheric haze

Negative: face visible, eyes, nose, mouth, frontal face, portrait,
photorealistic, photograph, cartoon, anime, 3D render, low quality,
blurry, text, watermark, modern clothing, oversaturated, neon colors
```

**Narrator consistency rules:**
- ALWAYS use the same character description (white thobe, red keffiyeh)
- ALWAYS use the same art style prefix
- Use seed locking if your image gen tool supports it
- If you have a trained LoRA for the narrator, use it here

---

### Strategy B: Story Scenes (`scene_category: "story"`)

These are UNIQUE to each story. The prompt is built dynamically from
the script's visual direction. You have creative freedom here, but must
maintain the overall art style and the faceless constraint.

**Story Scene Prompt Template:**
```
Cinematic digital concept art, painterly brushwork style,
{mood from visual_direction} atmosphere,
highly detailed, professional illustration —

{full scene description from visual_direction.description} —

{IF character_type == "story_figure":}
  Any human figures shown as silhouettes, back shots, extreme wide shots,
  or with faces naturally obscured by shadow, distance, or angle.
  No visible faces on any person. —

{lighting from visual_direction} —

{environment from visual_direction} —

9:16 vertical composition, 1080x1920, cinematic depth of field,
volumetric lighting, atmospheric haze

Negative: face visible, eyes, nose, mouth, frontal face, close-up portrait,
photorealistic photograph, cartoon, anime, 3D render, low quality, blurry,
text, watermark, modern elements, oversaturated
```

**Story scene rules:**
- Color palette CAN shift to match story mood (cooler for sad, warmer for hope)
- Art style MUST remain painterly/concept art (no switching to photorealistic)
- Environments should be historically appropriate (no anachronisms)
- If the scene has NO human figures, you have full creative freedom
- If the scene HAS human figures, they must ALL be faceless

## Ken Burns Motion Assignment

After generating each image, assign motion based on the script's
`camera_movement` field:

| camera_movement | Motion Config |
|----------------|---------------|
| slow_zoom_in | start: full frame → end: 80% crop centered on subject |
| slow_zoom_out | start: 80% crop → end: full frame |
| slow_pan_right | start: left 80% → end: right 80% |
| slow_pan_left | start: right 80% → end: left 80% |
| slow_pan_up | start: bottom 80% → end: top 80% |
| slow_pan_down | start: top 80% → end: bottom 80% |
| static_drift | start: full frame → end: 97% crop (barely perceptible) |

**All motion durations match the scene's `duration_seconds`.**
**Easing: always `ease_in_out` (smooth start and stop).**

## Face Detection Gate

After generating EVERY image, run face detection before accepting it.

```
For each generated image:
  1. Run face detection model
  2. If face detected:
     a. Log: "Face detected in scene {N}, attempt {X}/3"
     b. Modify prompt: add extra emphasis on faceless constraint
     c. Regenerate with new seed
     d. If 3 attempts fail: flag for human review, do NOT pass to assembly
  3. If no face: accept image
```

**Face detection tools (choose one):**
- OpenCV Haar Cascades — fast, good enough for obvious faces
- MTCNN — more accurate, catches partial faces
- RetinaFace — best accuracy, catches even small/distant faces
- Cloud: Google Vision API face detection, AWS Rekognition

Recommendation: Use RetinaFace or MTCNN. Haar cascades miss too many edge cases.

## Quality Gates — Do NOT pass to Assembly Agent if:
- [ ] ANY image has a detected face (even partial)
- [ ] Narrator scenes don't match the brand character description
- [ ] Any image is not 9:16 aspect ratio
- [ ] Art style varies wildly between scenes in the same video
- [ ] Any image contains text, watermarks, or modern elements
- [ ] Story scenes don't match the visual direction from the script
