# SMB Sales Boost — Claude Skill

A Claude skill that lets subscribers query the SMB Sales Boost lead database using natural language. Search, filter, and export newly registered small and medium businesses across the United States with comprehensive company data including contact information, location, and AI-enriched categories.

## Installation

Place the `smb-sales-boost/` folder in your Claude skills directory:

```
/mnt/skills/user/smb-sales-boost/
├── SKILL.md          # Skill instructions for Claude
├── smb_api.py        # Reusable API client (handles all endpoints + safe exports)
├── openapi.json      # Full OpenAPI 3.1 specification (reference)
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Requirements

- Active SMB Sales Boost subscription: **Pro**, **Platinum**, **Enterprise**, or **Agency**
- API key generated from Dashboard > API tab (keys start with `smbk_`)
- Base URL: `https://smbsalesboost.com/api/v1`

## Two Databases

SMB Sales Boost provides two separate lead databases:

- **Home Improvement** (`home_improvement`) — Home improvement/contractor businesses with star ratings, review counts, review snippets, profile URLs, and categories
- **Other** (`other`) — General newly registered businesses with registered URLs, crawled URLs, descriptions, primary email, primary phone, and redirect status

Each has different filterable fields. Users can switch between databases (with a cooldown period).

## What Users Can Do

Once the skill is installed, users can interact with SMB Sales Boost in natural language:

- **Search with wildcards:** "Find new dental practices in Texas" → searches `["*dental*", "*dentist*", "*orthodont*"]`
- **Multi-keyword search:** "Search for med spas, wellness clinics, and aesthetics businesses in California"
- **Filter by location:** "Show me businesses in Miami and Orlando"
- **Filter by rating:** "Find contractors with at least 4 stars in Phoenix" (home_improvement only)
- **Find fresh leads:** "Show me leads updated in the last week" (uses the Last Updated date — the best indicator of lead freshness)
- **Exclude terms:** "Find new bakeries in NYC but exclude pizza and franchise"
- **Export data:** "Export these leads as a CSV"
- **Manage filter presets:** "Save this search as 'FL Med Spas'"
- **Manage keyword lists:** "Create a keyword list for pet industry leads"
- **Set up email schedules:** "Email me new auto shop leads in Georgia every day"
- **AI suggestions:** "What categories should I target for my fitness equipment business?"
- **AI keywords:** "Generate keywords for my business"
- **Manage blacklist:** "Exclude example.com from future exports"
- **Account info:** "What subscription plan am I on?"

## Wildcard Keywords

The `positiveKeywords` and `negativeKeywords` parameters support `*` wildcard for flexible pattern matching:

- `"*dental*"` — matches "dental clinic", "pediatric dentistry", "dental lab", etc.
- `"*auto*repair*"` — matches "auto body repair", "automotive repair shop", etc.
- `"*med*spa*"` — matches "med spa", "medical spa", "medspa services", etc.

Use multiple variations for broader coverage — keywords are matched via OR logic:

```json
["*pet*groom*", "*dog*groom*", "*pet*salon*", "*mobile*groom*"]
```

Keywords without wildcards perform substring matching by default.

## Understanding "Last Updated"

The `lastUpdated` field is the primary way to identify the freshest, most actionable leads:

- **Home Improvement leads:** Last Updated means a new phone number was detected
- **Other leads:** Last Updated means the primary phone number and/or primary email address was updated
- Also includes newly added records
- Many businesses launch a website before adding contact info, so the Last Updated date captures when that information first becomes available

## Example Conversations

```
User: I sell commercial cleaning supplies. Find me newly registered 
      cleaning businesses in Florida and Georgia updated in the last 7 days.

Claude: [Calls GET /leads with 
         positiveKeywords=["*clean*service*","*janitorial*","*maid*service*","*pressure*wash*"],
         stateInclude=FL,GA, lastUpdatedFrom=2026-02-14]

I found 287 cleaning-related businesses in Florida and Georgia updated 
in the last week. Here are the first 10:

| Company Name               | City         | State | Phone        | Last Updated |
|----------------------------|--------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Sparkle Clean Services LLC | Jacksonville | FL    | 904-555-0189 | 2026-02-19   |
| Fresh Start Janitorial     | Atlanta      | GA    | 678-555-0234 | 2026-02-18   |
| ...                        | ...          | ...   | ...          | ...          |

Would you like me to export all 287 results, narrow the search,
or save this as a filter preset?
```

```
User: Now find me pet grooming and veterinary businesses in Texas,
      but exclude anything related to boarding or kennels.

Claude: [Calls GET /leads with 
         positiveKeywords=["*pet*groom*","*veterinar*","*vet*clinic*","*animal*hospital*"],
         negativeKeywords=["*boarding*","*kennel*","*pet*hotel*"],
         stateInclude=TX]

I found 156 pet grooming and veterinary businesses in Texas 
(excluding boarding/kennel businesses). Here are the first 10:

## Security

This skill addresses two specific agent execution risks identified by security scanning:

**1. Shell injection prevention:** All API requests go through the included `smb_api.py` client using Python's `requests` library. User-provided search terms, locations, and other inputs are passed as structured function arguments — never interpolated into shell command strings. This eliminates the shell injection vector that exists when agents construct `curl` commands from user input.

**2. Path traversal prevention in exports:** The `/leads/export` endpoint returns base64-encoded files with an API-provided `fileName` field. The script sanitizes all filenames before writing:
- Strips directory components via `os.path.basename()` (e.g., `../../etc/passwd` → `passwd`)
- Validates file extension against an allowlist (`.csv`, `.json`, `.xlsx` only)
- Writes only to a designated safe output directory — never to API-specified or user-specified paths

**3. API key protection:** Keys are passed as CLI arguments and sent only in the Authorization header — never logged, written to files, or included in error output.
