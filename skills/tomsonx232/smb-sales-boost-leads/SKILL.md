# SMB Sales Boost Skill

This skill enables natural language interaction with the SMB Sales Boost API — a B2B lead generation platform providing access to newly registered small and medium businesses across the United States.

## Setup

The user must provide their API key. Keys have a `smbk_` prefix and are generated from the Dashboard > API tab. The key is passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of every request.

**Base URL:** `https://smbsalesboost.com/api/v1`

**Important:** API access requires a Pro, Platinum, Enterprise, or Agency subscription plan.

## Authentication

All requests must include:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

If the user hasn't provided their API key yet, ask them for it before making any requests. Store it in a variable for reuse throughout the session.

## Rate Limits

- Exports: 1 export per 5 minutes
- AI category suggestions: 5 requests per minute
- AI keyword generation: 5 requests per minute

Rate limit headers are returned on every response: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`. If rate limited, check the `Retry-After` header for seconds to wait.

## Two Database Types

SMB Sales Boost has two separate databases:

1. **`home_improvement`** — Home improvement/contractor businesses with fields like star ratings, review counts, review snippets, profile URLs, and categories
2. **`other`** — General newly registered businesses with fields like registered URL, crawled URL, short/long descriptions, primary email, primary phone, and redirect status

Some filter parameters only work with one database type. The user's account has a default database setting. Always check which database the user wants to query.

## Core Endpoints

### 1. Search Leads — `GET /leads`

The primary endpoint. Translates natural language queries into filtered lead searches.

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `page` | integer | Page number (default: 1) |
| `limit` | integer | Results per page (max 1000, default 100) |
| `database` | string | `home_improvement` or `other` |
| `positiveKeywords` | JSON array string | Keywords to include (OR logic). Supports `*` wildcard for pattern matching (e.g., `["*dental*", "*ortho*"]`). Without wildcards, performs substring matching by default. |
| `negativeKeywords` | JSON array string | Keywords to exclude (AND logic). Also supports `*` wildcard (e.g., `["*franchise*"]`). |
| `orColumns` | JSON array string | Column names to search keywords against |
| `stateInclude` | string | Comma-separated state codes: `CA,NY,TX` |
| `stateExclude` | string | Comma-separated state codes to exclude |
| `cityInclude` | JSON array string | Cities to include |
| `cityExclude` | JSON array string | Cities to exclude |
| `zipInclude` | JSON array string | ZIP codes to include |
| `zipExclude` | JSON array string | ZIP codes to exclude |
| `nameIncludeTerms` | JSON array string | Business name include terms |
| `nameExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Business name exclude terms |
| `lastUpdatedFrom` | date string | Filter by Last Updated date (after this date) |
| `lastUpdatedTo` | date string | Filter by Last Updated date (before this date) |

**Understanding "Last Updated" — this is critical for finding the freshest leads:**
- **Home Improvement leads:** Last Updated means a new phone number was detected
- **Other leads:** Last Updated means the primary phone number and/or primary email address was updated
- Both databases also include newly added records in this date
- Many businesses launch a website before adding contact info, so the Last Updated date captures when that information first becomes available — making it the primary way to identify the most actionable leads

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `countryInclude` | JSON array string | Countries to include |
| `countryExclude` | JSON array string | Countries to exclude |
| `sortBy` | string | Field to sort by |
| `sortOrder` | string | `asc` or `desc` (default: `desc`) |

**Wildcard Keyword Tips:**
- Use `*` to match any characters: `"*dental*"` matches "dental clinic", "pediatric dentistry", etc.
- Combine wildcards for compound terms: `"*auto*repair*"` matches "auto body repair", "automotive repair shop", etc.
- Use multiple keyword variations for broader coverage: `["*dental*", "*dentist*", "*orthodont*"]`
- Keywords without wildcards still perform substring matching by default

**Home Improvement Only:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `minStars` / `maxStars` | number | Star rating range |
| `minReviewCount` / `maxReviewCount` | integer | Review count range |
| `categoriesIncludeTerms` / `categoriesExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Category filters |
| `reviewSnippetIncludeTerms` / `reviewSnippetExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Review text filters |
| `profileUrlIncludeTerms` / `profileUrlExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Profile URL filters |

**Other Database Only:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `urlIncludeTerms` / `urlExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Registered URL filters |
| `crawledUrlIncludeTerms` / `crawledUrlExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Crawled URL filters |
| `descriptionIncludeTerms` / `descriptionExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Short description filters |
| `descriptionLongIncludeTerms` / `descriptionLongExcludeTerms` | JSON array string | Long description filters |
| `emailPrimaryInclude` / `emailPrimaryExclude` | JSON array string | Primary email filters |
| `phonePrimaryInclude` / `phonePrimaryExclude` | JSON array string | Primary phone filters |
| `redirectFilter` | string | `yes` or `no` — filter by redirect status |

**Important:** At least one positive filter is required (positiveKeywords or any column-specific include terms).

**Response includes:** `leads` array, `totalCount`, `page`, `limit`, `databaseType`

**Lead fields:** `id`, `companyName`, `state`, `city`, `zip`, `phone`, `email`, `categories`, `lastUpdated` (phone/email masked for free users). The `lastUpdated` field indicates when contact information was last detected or updated — this is the best indicator of lead freshness and actionability.

### 2. Export Leads — `POST /leads/export`

Export filtered leads as CSV, JSON, or XLSX files.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "database": "home_improvement" | "other",
  "filters": { /* same filter params as GET /leads */ },

}
```

**Response:** `files` array (with base64-encoded data), `leadCount`, `exportId`, `databaseType`

Rate limited: 1 export per 5 minutes, max 10,000 leads per export.

## Natural Language Translation Guide

When users make natural language requests, translate them into API calls. Use multiple wildcard keyword variations to cast a wider net — keywords are matched via OR logic so more variations means better coverage:

| User Says | API Call |
|-----------|---------|
| "Find new dental practices in Texas" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*dental*","*dentist*","*orthodont*"]&stateInclude=TX` |
| "Search for med spas and aesthetics businesses in Florida" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*med*spa*","*medical*spa*","*aesthet*","*botox*","*medspa*"]&stateInclude=FL` |
| "Show me auto repair shops in Chicago updated this week" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*auto*repair*","*body*shop*","*mechanic*","*oil*change*","*brake*"]&cityInclude=["Chicago"]&lastUpdatedFrom=2026-02-14` |
| "Find pet grooming businesses in California, exclude boarding" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*pet*groom*","*dog*groom*","*pet*salon*"]&negativeKeywords=["*boarding*","*kennel*"]&stateInclude=CA` |
| "Get bakeries and catering companies in New York" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*bakery*","*bake*shop*","*cater*","*pastry*","*cake*"]&stateInclude=NY` |
| "Find fitness studios in Georgia and North Carolina" | `GET /leads?positiveKeywords=["*fitness*","*gym*","*yoga*","*pilates*","*crossfit*"]&stateInclude=GA,NC` |
| "Get 50 leads with high ratings" | `GET /leads?limit=50&minStars=4` (home_improvement only) |
| "Export all my filtered results" | `POST /leads/export` with current filters |
| "What categories should I target?" | `POST /ai/suggest-categories` |
| "Save this search as 'FL Med Spas'" | `POST /filter-presets` |
| "Show my recent exports" | `GET /export-history` |
| "What plan am I on?" | `GET /me` |
| "Exclude these domains from exports" | `POST /export-blacklist` |

## Building API Requests

Use the included `smb_api.py` script for all API calls. It handles authentication, URL encoding, response parsing, and safe file export in a single reusable file. **Do not use shell commands like `curl`** — constructing shell commands from user-provided input risks shell injection vulnerabilities.

### Usage

```bash
python smb_api.py <API_KEY> <METHOD> <ENDPOINT> [--params '{"key":"value"}'] [--body '{"key":"value"}'] [--output-dir /path/to/dir]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Search for med spas in Florida using wildcard keywords (OR logic)
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx GET /leads --params '{"positiveKeywords":"[\"*med*spa*\",\"*medical*spa*\",\"*aesthet*\",\"*botox*\",\"*medspa*\"]","stateInclude":"FL","limit":"25"}'

# Find auto shops in multiple states, exclude franchises
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx GET /leads --params '{"positiveKeywords":"[\"*auto*repair*\",\"*body*shop*\",\"*mechanic*\",\"*tire*\",\"*oil*change*\"]","negativeKeywords":"[\"*franchise*\",\"*jiffy*\"]","stateInclude":"GA,FL,NC,SC,TN","limit":"50"}'

# Search for recently updated dental leads in Texas
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx GET /leads --params '{"positiveKeywords":"[\"*dental*\",\"*dentist*\",\"*orthodont*\",\"*oral*surg*\"]","stateInclude":"TX","lastUpdatedFrom":"2026-02-14"}'

# Get account info
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx GET /me

# Export pet industry leads (files saved automatically to --output-dir)
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx POST /leads/export --body '{"database":"other","filters":{"positiveKeywords":["*pet*groom*","*veterinar*","*dog*train*","*pet*board*"],"stateInclude":"CA,OR,WA"}}'

# AI category suggestions for a fitness equipment distributor
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx POST /ai/suggest-categories --body '{"companyName":"FitPro Supply","companyDescription":"Commercial fitness equipment distributor","productService":"Gym equipment, treadmills, weight systems"}'

# Create a filter preset for bakery/catering leads
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx POST /filter-presets --body '{"name":"NY Bakeries","filters":{"positiveKeywords":["*bakery*","*bake*shop*","*cater*","*pastry*"],"stateInclude":"NY"}}'

# Delete a filter preset
python smb_api.py smbk_xxx DELETE /filter-presets/42
```

The script outputs JSON to stdout and rate limit headers to stderr. For export requests, files are automatically saved with sanitized filenames.

**Remember:**
- Use multiple wildcard keyword variations to cast a wider net (e.g., `["*dental*", "*dentist*", "*orthodont*"]` not just `["dental"]`) — keywords are matched via OR logic
- Use `*` for flexible pattern matching: `"*auto*repair*"` matches "auto body repair", "automotive repair shop", etc.
- JSON array parameters should be serialized as strings inside the `--params` JSON
- At least one positive filter is required for lead searches
- Check which database the user needs before applying database-specific filters
- Phone and email are masked for free-tier users
- Present results in a clean, readable table format

## Security

This skill addresses two specific agent execution risks: **shell injection** from constructing CLI commands with user input, and **arbitrary file writes** from unsanitized API-provided filenames.

**Shell injection prevention:** The `smb_api.py` script uses Python's `requests` library for all HTTP calls. User-provided search terms, locations, and other inputs are passed as structured function arguments — never interpolated into shell command strings. This eliminates the shell injection vector that exists when agents construct `curl` commands from user input.

**Path traversal prevention in exports:** The `/leads/export` endpoint returns base64-encoded files with an API-provided `fileName` field. A malicious or corrupted filename (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) could write files to arbitrary locations. The script enforces three safeguards:
1. **Basename extraction:** `os.path.basename()` strips all directory components — `../../etc/passwd` becomes `passwd`
2. **Extension validation:** Only `.csv`, `.json`, and `.xlsx` extensions are allowed; anything else defaults to `.csv`
3. **Scoped output directory:** Files are written only to the designated output directory (`/mnt/user-data/outputs/` by default), never to user-specified or API-specified paths

**API key handling:** The key is passed as a CLI argument and sent only in the Authorization header. It is never logged, written to files, or included in error output.

## Error Handling

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request — check parameters |
| 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403 | Active subscription required |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 429 | Rate limited — check `Retry-After` header |
| 500 | Server error |

All errors return: `{ "error": "error_code", "message": "Human-readable message" }`
