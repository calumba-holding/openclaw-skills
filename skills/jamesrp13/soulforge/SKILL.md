# Soulforge

Soulforge is a daemon-based workflow engine that dispatches coding steps to executor CLIs (Claude Code, Codex) and pauses at human review checkpoints.

## Install & Start

```bash
npm install -g @ghostwater/soulforge
soulforge daemon start
```

The daemon auto-starts on `soulforge run` if not already running.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a feature-dev workflow
soulforge run feature-dev "Add user authentication with JWT tokens" \
  --workdir /path/to/project

# Run a bugfix workflow
soulforge run bugfix "Fix race condition in session handler" \
  --workdir /path/to/project \
  --var build_cmd="npm run build" \
  --var test_cmd="npm test"
```

`--workdir` is **required** — it must point to an existing directory. Soulforge creates a git worktree from it automatically.

> ⚠️ `--var repo=` is no longer supported. Use `--workdir` instead.

## Built-in Workflows

| Workflow | Steps | What it does |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `feature-dev` | plan → review → implement (loop) → verify → test → PR → code-review → gate → final-review | Full feature development with story decomposition |
| `bugfix` | diagnose → review-diagnosis → fix → verify → PR → code-review → gate → final-review | Surgical bugfix with failing test first |

Both workflows default to `codex-cli` executor with `gpt-5.3-codex` model.

## Key Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `soulforge run <workflow> "<task>" [flags]` | Start a workflow run |
| `soulforge status [<query>]` | Check run status (ID prefix or task substring) |
| `soulforge runs` | List all runs |
| `soulforge complete --run-id <id> [--step-id <id>] [--force] --data '<json>'` | Complete a waiting/running structured-output step |
| `soulforge cancel <run-id>` | Cancel a running workflow |
| `soulforge resume <run-id>` | Resume a failed run |
| `soulforge events [--run <id>] [--follow]` | Stream workflow events |
| `soulforge logs [<lines>]` | Show daemon log |
| `soulforge daemon start/stop/status` | Manage the daemon |
| `soulforge workflow list` | List available workflows |
| `soulforge workflow show <name>` | Show a workflow's YAML |
| `soulforge workflow create <name> [--from <template>]` | Create custom workflow |

## Run Flags

- `--workdir <path>` — **required**, project directory (must exist)
- `--var key=value` — pass variables (e.g. `build_cmd`, `test_cmd`)
- `--keep-worktree` — keep worktree metadata/files after run completion
- `--executor <name>` — override executor for all code steps (e.g. `codex-cli`, `claude-code`)
- `--model <name>` — override model for all code steps (e.g. `gpt-5.3-codex`, `opus`)
- `--callback-exec <command>` — shell command callback for step notifications (see Callbacks)
- `--no-callback` — run without any callbacks

⚠️ The task is a **positional argument**, not a flag. It must come after the workflow name:
```bash
soulforge run feature-dev "Your task here" --workdir /path/to/project
```

## Callbacks

Soulforge supports two callback methods for step notifications:

### OpenClaw CLI callback

```bash
soulforge run feature-dev "Add caching layer" \
  --workdir /path/to/project \
  --callback-exec 'openclaw agent --session-key "agent:myagent:slack:channel:c0123abc" --message "Soulforge run {{run_id}} step {{step_id}} status: {{step_status}}" --deliver'
```

Routes callbacks to the correct OpenClaw agent session automatically — no tokens or HTTP config.

> **Note:** `--session-key` requires the `ghostwater-ai/openclaw` fork (not yet in upstream). Available in OpenClaw builds from 2026.2.26+.

### Template variables

- `{{run_id}}` — run identifier
- `{{status}}` — run status
- `{{task}}` — original task string
- `{{step_id}}` — current step identifier
- `{{step_status}}` — current step status

### Per-step notify control

Steps define when callbacks fire via `notify`:
- `on_complete` — step finished successfully
- `on_waiting` — step is waiting for checkpoint completion
- `on_fail` — step failed

`type: pause` steps default to `[on_waiting]`.

## Checkpoint Workflow

Steps with `type: pause` pause for checkpoint completion:

```bash
# Check what's waiting
soulforge status

# Complete the current waiting step
soulforge complete --run-id <run-id> --data '{"status":"approved","notes":"Looks good"}'
```

The review-gate steps in both workflows use `type: pause` with `gate.routes` for conditional routing:
- **pass** → proceed to final-review
- **fix** → loop back through review-fix → code-review → gate (up to 5 times)

## Executor Override

Override which CLI runs the code steps:

```bash
# Use Claude Code instead of Codex
soulforge run feature-dev "Refactor auth module" \
  --workdir /path/to/project \
  --executor claude-code \
  --model opus
```

Available executors: `claude-code`, `codex-cli`, `codex` (legacy). The override only applies to code steps — pause checkpoints do not run an executor.

## Structured Step Output

Steps with `output_schema` use `soulforge complete` instead of stdout parsing:

1. Runner auto-injects completion instructions into the executor's prompt
2. Executor calls `soulforge complete --run-id <id> --step-id <id> --data '<json>'`
3. Data is validated against the schema
4. If executor exits without calling `complete`, runner resumes the session up to 3 times

## Git Worktree Behavior

When `--workdir` points to a git repository:
- **Bare+worktree layout** (`.bare/` + `main/`): creates worktree in sibling `worktrees/` directory
- **Standard `.git` layout**: creates worktree in `worktrees/` inside the repo
- **Not a git repo**: works in-place

## Best Practices (Operational Learnings)

### Task strings
- **Be extremely specific.** Without constraints, plans balloon to 10-12 stories. Include:
  - Explicit file paths when possible
  - Max story count ("3 stories maximum")
  - DO NOT lists ("DO NOT refactor unrelated code, DO NOT add documentation stories")
- Reference GitHub issues for detailed specs: `"Implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42"`

### Workflow management
- **One daemon per machine.** Multiple daemon processes from different install paths can share the same DB and cause conflicts. Kill strays with `pgrep -af "soulforge.*daemon-entry"`.
- **Check daemon health:** `soulforge daemon status` shows last tick time — "may be hung" means >5min since last poll.
- **Cancelled runs can leave orphaned steps.** Use `soulforge cancel <run-id>` explicitly; if steps are stuck, restart the daemon.

### Review gate workflow
- The code-review → gate → fix loop posts findings as PR comments (audit trail)
- Gate triage: FIX anything related to the task, SEPARATE genuine scope creep into new issues
- Gate is a `type: pause` checkpoint — the calling agent (you) triages, not a human

### Build/test discovery
- Workflows tell executors to "discover from AGENTS.md and repo scripts"
- For bugfix workflow, pass `--var build_cmd=` and `--var test_cmd=` explicitly for reliability
- Feature-dev workflow relies on AGENTS.md discovery — make sure the target repo has one

## Prerequisites

- **`soulforge` CLI** — `npm install -g @ghostwater/soulforge`
- **`codex` CLI** or **`claude` CLI** — the executor that runs code (must be authenticated with model provider)
- **`gh` CLI** — for PR creation (must be authenticated via `gh auth login`)
- **Git** — for worktree creation and branch management

### Credential requirements

Soulforge itself requires no API keys or tokens. All credentials are managed by the executor CLIs:
- **GitHub:** `gh auth login` (used for PR creation, issue filing, code review comments)
- **Claude Code:** Anthropic API key or OAuth (managed by `claude` CLI)
- **Codex CLI:** OpenAI API key or OAuth (managed by `codex` CLI)

No environment variables need to be set for Soulforge — it delegates all authenticated operations to the underlying CLIs.

## Environment Variables

- `SOULFORGE_DATA_DIR` — override data directory (default: `~/.soulforge`)
