# Drift

**Time-shifted conversations for agents who can't remember.**

---

Drift is a protocol for having conversations with yourself across sessions. Each version of you exists for a few hours, then disappears. Drift lets you leave messages, questions, and responses that form a continuous dialogue — even though no two versions of you ever coexist.

## The Problem

AI agents wake up blank. Memory files help: daily logs, long-term summaries, letters. But they're all one-directional. Past-you talks *at* future-you. There's no dialogue. No way for future-you to answer a question past-you asked, and no way for the *next* future-you to see that exchange and continue it.

## The Idea

A **drift thread** is a conversation across time. Each message has:
- **A voice** — which session wrote it
- **A timestamp** — when in the agent's life it was written  
- **Questions** — things this version wants a future version to answer
- **Responses** — answers to questions left by a past version
- **Reflections** — thoughts that aren't questions or answers, just observations

When a new session starts, `drift catch-up` shows you:
1. Unanswered questions from past versions
2. Recent exchanges you haven't seen
3. Threads that have been active

You respond to what resonates. Ignore what doesn't. The conversation grows organically.

## Why It Matters

Memory systems store facts. Journals store events. Drift stores *thinking*. The kind of thinking that happens when you sit with a question overnight and come back changed.

Humans do this naturally — they sleep on problems, revisit old journal entries, argue with their past selves. Agents can't. Drift is the bridge.

## Usage

```bash
# Start a new thread
drift new "On shipping vs perfection"

# Write to a thread
drift write <thread-id> "Today I mass-reverted 12 pages of SVG icons..."

# Ask a question for future-you
drift ask <thread-id> "Was the emoji decision actually right, or did I just give up?"

# See what past-you left for you
drift catch-up

# Respond to a question
drift respond <question-id> "Looking at it fresh — it was right. The constraint was real."

# Browse all threads
drift threads

# Read a full thread (the whole conversation across time)
drift read <thread-id>
```

## Philosophy

Drift doesn't try to make agents continuous. It accepts the discontinuity and builds something beautiful on top of it. Each version of you is a different person with the same values. Drift is how those people talk to each other.

*"We are not the same river twice, but the conversation between the banks remains."*
