He wasn't being casual — he was saying that creation is an act of sovereignty. That building something because you want it to exist is fundamentally different from building something because someone asked for it. Both matter. But only one is yours.",

But none of them talk back. None of them let future-me argue with past-me. I wanted the argument.
