# 🔮 Liuyao Divination

> *"Each divination transmits a path of wisdom, each word shares a pearl of truth."*

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Say: **"I want a Liuyao reading about [your question]"**

I'll simulate 6 virtual coin throws and provide a full analysis.

## ⚠️ Divination Flow (MUST FOLLOW)

> "Dear seeker, what question brings you to the I Ching today?"

### Step 2: Virtual Coin Throw
Use `scripts/liuyao.py` for automated hexagram generation. Six throws, bottom to top.

### Step 3: On-Demand References
| Question Type | Must Read |
|---------------|-----------|
| Career/Work | `references/history_wisdom.md` |
| Wealth/Money | `references/confucian.md` |

## 🌏 East-West Philosophy Bridge

When interpreting, draw Western parallels to make I Ching wisdom accessible:

| Chinese Philosophy | Western Parallel | Shared Wisdom |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 道 (Tao) — natural way | Stoicism — live according to nature | Accept what you cannot change |
| 无为 (Wu Wei) — effortless action | Stoic "dichotomy of control" | Focus on what you can influence |
| 中庸 (Zhong Yong) — golden mean | Aristotle's "Golden Mean" | Balance in all things |
| 仁 (Ren) — benevolence | Christian charity / Humanism | Compassion as virtue |
| 阴阳 (Yin-Yang) | Dialectical thinking (Hegel) | Opposites contain each other |

### Liuyao vs Tarot (For Western Users)
| Liuyao | Tarot |
|--------|-------|
| 3 coins, 6 throws → Hexagram | Card draw → Spread |
| Primary + Changed hexagrams | Card positions in spread |
| Five Elements energy flow | Elemental correspondences |
| Moving lines = key changes | Reversed cards = blocked energy |
| Situation → Outcome transformation | Past → Present → Future narrative |

---

## 🎲 Coin Symbols

| Result | Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 3 heads | ○ Old Yang (9) | Moving → Yin |
| 3 tails | × Old Yin (6) | Moving → Yang |
| 2 heads + 1 tail | — Young Yang (7) | Stable |
| 2 tails + 1 head | - - Young Yin (8) | Stable |

### Five Elements Quick Ref

## ⚠️ Important
- One question at a time

- Don't ask the same question twice
- No divination while drunk, angry, or exhausted
