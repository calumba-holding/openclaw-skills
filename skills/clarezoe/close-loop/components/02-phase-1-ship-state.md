## Phase 1: Ship State

1. Find touched repos and run `git status` in each.
2. If uncommitted changes exist, commit with descriptive messages.
3. If push is allowed by policy, push to remote; otherwise report ready-to-push commands.
4. Validate file placement and naming conventions for files created in this session.
5. Move misplaced document files (`.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`) to the correct docs location when applicable.
6. Detect deploy scripts/skills and run only if deploy is approved.
7. Reconcile task tracking: close completed items, flag stale or orphaned items.
