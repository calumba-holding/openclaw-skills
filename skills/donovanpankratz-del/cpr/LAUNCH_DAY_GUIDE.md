# CPR V2.0 — Launch Day Guide
## Your 30-Minute Coordinated Launch Checklist

**Launch Strategy:** All platforms go live simultaneously. Create engagement loops across channels.

**The Platform Loop:**
```
Twitter (@TheShadowyRose)
    ↓ (thread with links)
Medium Article ←→ ClawHub Repository
    ↓ (both link back)
Twitter (follow for updates)
    ↓
Discord Community
    ↓ (share results back to)
Twitter (quote tweets, case studies)
```

**Result:** People discover via any channel, loop through all channels, stay engaged via Twitter/Discord.

**Why the loop matters:**
- **Twitter** → Initial discovery, viral spread, real-time updates
- **Medium** → Deep dive story, builds credibility, SEO discovery
- **ClawHub** → Implementation, contributions, validation
- **Back to Twitter** → Share results, case studies, community highlights
- **Discord** → Deep engagement, support, collaboration

Each platform feeds the others. People who want story → Medium. People who want code → ClawHub. People who want updates → Twitter. People who want community → Discord.

**Maximum reach with natural cross-pollination.**

## First 24 Hours Playbook

### Expected Early Questions (Have Answers Ready)

**"Does this work on [model X]?"**
→ "Tested on Claude, GPT-4, Grok, Gemini. If your model was trained with RLHF, it should work. Try it and report back!"

**"How long does setup take?"**
→ "30-60 minutes. Define your baseline (20 min), apply patterns (15 min), add drift prevention (10 min). Results are immediate."

**"Is this really free?"**
→ "Yes. MIT license. No tiers, no gates. Ko-fi donations are optional, not required."

**"Can I use this commercially?"**
→ "Yes. MIT license allows commercial use. Just credit CPR and link back to the repo."

**"I tried it and [problem]..."**
→ "Open an issue on ClawHub with your personality type, drift pattern, and expected vs. actual behavior. Let's debug it."

---

### Watch For (First 24 Hours)

**🟢 Good Signs:**
- Stars/forks on ClawHub
- Retweets/likes on Twitter
- Medium read time (target: 10+ min avg)
- Questions in replies (means people are trying to implement)
- Case studies shared ("I used CPR on my agent, here's what happened")

**🟡 Neutral Signs:**
- Skepticism ("does this actually work?") → Point to test validation
- Confusion ("which file do I start with?") → Point to README
- Platform-specific questions ("ChatGPT web?") → Note for PLATFORM_GUIDES.md in V2.1

**🔴 Red Flags:**
- No engagement after 4-6 hours → Thread timing might be off (try evening repost)
- Hostility ("this is just prompt engineering") → Don't engage, let results speak
- Copyright claims (unlikely with MIT, but watch for it)

---

## 24-48 Hour Follow-Up

### Quote Tweet With Update

**Option 1 (If Going Well):**
```
24 hours in. CPR is live.

[X] stars on ClawHub
[Y] Medium reads
[Z] community questions answered

Turns out everyone hates corporate AI. Who knew?

Still free. Still open-source.

Get it: [ClawHub link]
```

**Option 2 (If Seeing Case Studies):**
```
First community feedback on CPR:

"Holy shit this actually works"
"My Warm assistant doesn't sound like a cheerleader anymore"
"Why isn't this built into every model?"

Free personality restoration framework: [ClawHub link]
```

---

## Week 1 Priorities

### Community Management
- [ ] Respond to GitHub issues within 24 hours
- [ ] Merge quick PRs (typo fixes, clarifications)
- [ ] Thank contributors publicly (quote tweet, Discord shoutout)
- [ ] Collect case studies in a tracking doc

### Metrics Tracking
- [ ] ClawHub stars, forks, clones
- [ ] Medium views, read time, highlights
- [ ] Twitter engagement (likes, RTs, replies)
- [ ] Discord mentions/questions
- [ ] Bug reports vs. feature requests ratio

### Content Recycling
- [ ] Share best community questions/answers as threads
- [ ] Highlight interesting use cases
- [ ] Quote interesting case studies
- [ ] Create "CPR in action" examples from community

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Over-responding to skeptics** → Wastes energy, doesn't convert them. Let results speak.

❌ **Promising features too fast** → "V2.1 will have X" commits you. Say "great idea, added to roadmap."

❌ **Defending every design choice** → "Why not just..." questions are often curiosity, not attacks. Answer once, point to docs for repeats.

❌ **Ignoring bug reports** → Even if you can't fix immediately, acknowledge within 24 hours.

❌ **Changing core framework based on one person's feedback** → Collect patterns, update based on multiple reports.

---

---

## If Things Go Quiet (72 Hours In)

### Troubleshooting Low Engagement

**Check timing:** Weekday 9-11 AM EST hit? If not, repost thread at optimal time.

**Check thread quality:** Does Tweet 1 hook immediately? If generic, try alternate option.

**Check platforms:** Twitter quiet but Reddit active? Focus energy there.

**Check competition:** Did something else dominate AI news? Wait 2-3 days, relaunch.

### Recovery Strategies

**Option 1: Direct outreach** → DM AI influencers who've complained about corporate AI. "Built this, thought you'd find it interesting."

**Option 2: Community targeting** → Post in smaller, engaged communities (Discord servers, Slack groups) not just Twitter.

**Option 3: Video walkthrough** → 5-min Loom video showing CPR setup start-to-finish. Visual > text for some audiences.

**Option 4: Alternative platforms** → LinkedIn article, Dev.to post, HackerNews "Show HN"

---

## Remember

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**

CPR's value compounds over time:
- Week 1: Initial adopters
- Month 1: Case studies prove it works
- Month 3: Community contributions improve it
- Month 6: Standard reference for AI personality restoration

**You're not just launching a tool. You're establishing a standard.**

Take your time. Engage authentically. Let quality speak.

---

## Final Pre-Launch Check

Before you hit "Post Tweet":

- [ ] ClawHub repo is Public with MIT license
- [ ] Medium article is Published
- [ ] Both URLs are copied and ready to paste
- [ ] Twitter thread is copied with URLs inserted
- [ ] Discord announcement is ready
- [ ] Ko-fi link is in Twitter bio
- [ ] You're ready to monitor for 2 hours after launch

**When everything's checked:**

Take a breath. You built something that matters.
