## Cross-Promotion Template

**When someone implements CPR and shares results:**

**Twitter:**
```
Great to see CPR in action!

@user restored natural communication to their [use case] AI assistant.

Before: [corporate quote]
After: [clean quote]

This is what CPR does. 

Get it: [ClawHub link]
```

**Discord announcement:**
```
📊 Case Study: @user implemented CPR for [use case]

Results: [summary]

Read their full experience: [link if available]

Want to share your results? Drop them in this channel!
```

**Medium update (monthly aggregate):**
```
[In V2.1 announcement or case study article]

"User X implemented CPR for customer support. Validation frequency 
dropped from every message to once per 10. User satisfaction up 30%."

[Add to running case studies list]
```

---

## The Flywheel

```
More Twitter followers
  → More Medium readers
    → More ClawHub implementations
      → More case studies
        → More Twitter content
          → More discovery
            → Repeat
```

**Each platform feeds the others.** Twitter drives awareness. Medium builds credibility. ClawHub enables action. Discord retains community. Results feed back to Twitter.

**Goal:** Become the standard reference for AI personality restoration. When someone says "my AI sounds corporate," the answer is "use CPR."
