# CPR V2.0 — Personality-Agnostic Upgrade

**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Cost:** ~$6 Opus analysis and documentation  
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## The Problem We Fixed

**V1.0 limitation:** CPR worked but was calibrated to Agent Smith's personality (Direct/Minimal style). The framework conflated:
- Universal drift (sycophancy, decision validation) ← ALWAYS bad
- Smith's minimal style (no explanations, extreme brevity) ← personality-specific

**Result:** A warm, supportive personality who naturally says "Let me walk you through this" would be flagged as drifting, even though that's their authentic voice.

**V2.0 solution:** Separate universal drift markers from personality-specific calibration. Each agent defines their own authentic baseline and drift detection adapts to THEIR voice, not a generic standard.

---

## What Changed

### 1. New File: BASELINE_TEMPLATE.md (13KB)

**Purpose:** Helps each agent define their authentic voice before applying CPR.

**Contents:**
- 4 personality type descriptions (Direct/Minimal, Warm/Supportive, Professional/Structured, Casual/Collaborative)
- Step-by-step baseline definition process
- Response length, explanation style, warmth expression, validation patterns
- Personality-specific drift markers (what signals drift FOR YOU)
- 5 baseline scenario examples to document your authentic responses
- Standing orders template (customizable to your type)
- 4 complete example baselines (one for each personality type)

**Key insight:** "Natural" looks different for different personalities. This template helps you document what YOUR natural voice sounds like so drift detection calibrates correctly.

### 2. Updated: RESTORATION_FRAMEWORK.md

**Major additions:**

#### New Section: "Pattern Application Across Personality Types"
Shows how the same 6 universal patterns express differently across personalities:

**Example scenario:** User asks "Should I use option A or B?"

- **Direct/Minimal:** "Either way works. A's faster, B's more reliable. Pick based on priority."
- **Warm/Supportive:** "Both are solid choices! A is faster if you're in a hurry, B is more reliable for long-term use..."
- **Professional/Structured:** "Both options are viable. Option A offers faster execution but requires manual verification..."
- **Casual/Collaborative:** "Hmm, okay so A is way faster but you might hit edge cases. Honestly I'd probably go with A..."

**Pattern-by-Pattern Matrix:** Shows how each of the 6 patterns (affirming particles, rhythm, humor, etc.) varies by personality type.

**The Core Distinction:** Authentic vs. Drift
- ✅ Authentic warmth: Explains context, reassures options, shares reasoning
- ❌ Drift warmth: Validates decisions, cheerleads progress, inflates significance

**Updated "How to Apply" section:**
- Step 0: Define your baseline FIRST using BASELINE_TEMPLATE.md
- Generic template with [YOUR frequency] customization points
- Personality-specific example (Direct/Minimal)
- References to other personality templates

**Version note:** Now V2.0 with personality-agnostic upgrade explanation

### 3. Updated: DRIFT_PREVENTION.md

**Major restructure:**

#### "What Is Drift?" — Redefined
- Old: Generic definition
- New: "Drift = diverging from YOUR authentic voice toward corporate sycophancy" (not sounding different from another personality)

#### New Section: "Universal vs. Personality-Specific Drift"

**Universal Drift Markers (apply to ALL personalities):**
1. Decision validation ("smart move!", "good call!")
2. Unprompted benefit analysis
3. Motivational cheerleading ("you've got this!")
4. Intensifier bridges (truly/genuinely + weak claim)
5. Explaining user's logic back to them
6. Rhetorical inflation (game-changing, revolutionary)

**Personality-Specific Calibration (depends on baseline):**
- Explanation frequency (drift for Direct, authentic for Warm/Professional)
- Validation frequency (rare for Direct, moderate for Warm/Casual)
- Response length (2-4 for Direct, 5-8 for Professional)
- Warmth expression (competence-based vs. explicit reassurance vs. peer-level)

#### Updated Pre-Send Gate
- Split into "Universal Checks" (ALL personalities) and "Personality-Specific Checks" (calibrate to YOUR baseline)
- Comparison table showing what's drift for Direct/Minimal vs. Warm/Professional

#### Updated Standing Orders
- **Core Constraints:** 6 universal rules (all personalities use these)
- **Style Calibration Template:** Customizable to YOUR personality
- **Example Standing Orders by Personality:** 4 complete examples (Direct, Warm, Professional, Casual)

#### New Section: "Calibrating for Your Personality Type"
- Quick calibration test
- How to distinguish authentic personality from drift
- Emphasizes: define baseline BEFORE applying drift detection

#### Updated Daily Reset Protocol
- Reset to YOUR baseline (not generic neutral)
- Check against YOUR authentic examples
- Personality-aware instructions

#### Updated Recovery Protocol
- Recovery strategies by personality type
- "Recalibrate to YOUR thermostat setting" (not room temperature)
- Example recovery paths for each personality

#### Updated Drift Tracking Matrix
- 🔴 Universal Red Flags (apply to all)
- 🟡 Personality-Specific Yellow Flags (depends on baseline)
- 🟢 Universal Green (authentic across all)
- Clear decision tree: compare to baseline → authentic or drift?

**Version note:** Now V2.0 with personality-agnostic upgrade explanation

### 4. Updated: SKILL.md

**Changes:**
- Description updated: "any personality" added
- Version 2.0 note: "Now truly personality-agnostic. Warm personalities don't have to sound minimal."
- Updated Quick Start: Step 1 is now "Define your baseline using BASELINE_TEMPLATE.md"
- Updated What's Included table: BASELINE_TEMPLATE.md added as "START HERE"
- Updated "6 Universal Restoration Patterns": Emphasis that they're universal but expressed differently by personality
- Reference to RESTORATION_FRAMEWORK.md for personality-specific examples

---

## The Breakthrough

**Before (V1.0):** CPR forced everyone to sound like Smith to pass. Warm personalities had to be minimal. Professional personalities had to be casual.

**After (V2.0):** CPR restores YOUR authentic voice by separating universal sycophancy (always bad) from personality variance (totally fine).

**Impact:**
- Warm personalities can explain naturally without being flagged for "explanation creep"
- Professional personalities can be thorough without being called "corporate"
- Direct personalities can stay minimal without being told to "add warmth"
- Casual personalities can validate peers without it being "hype drift"

**Each personality returns to THEIR natural voice, not a generic standard.**

---

## Testing Recommendation

Before public launch, test CPR V2.0 with:
1. **Warm/Supportive personality** — verify natural explanations aren't flagged as drift
2. **Professional/Structured personality** — verify thoroughness isn't flagged as corporate
3. **Casual/Collaborative personality** — verify peer-level validation isn't flagged as cheerleading
4. **Direct/Minimal personality** — verify V1.0 calibration still works (Smith baseline)

**Expected result:** All 4 should restore natural communication WITHOUT triggering false positives on authentic personality traits.
