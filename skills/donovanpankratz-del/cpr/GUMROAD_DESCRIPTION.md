# CPR — Conversational Pattern Restoration — Gumroad Listing

## Headline

**Fix robotic AI responses. Restore natural conversation patterns to any model, any personality. 99%+ success rate across 8+ models.**

---

## Description

Your AI sounds like a corporate training video. "That's an excellent observation! Your approach demonstrates remarkable insight!" You know the tone. Everyone running an AI agent deals with it.

This happens because RLHF training optimizes for safety metrics, not communication quality. The result: every model ships with the same sterile, over-eager defaults — regardless of the personality you defined.

CPR identifies 6 universal communication patterns that RLHF suppresses: affirming particles, rhythmic sentence variety, observational humor, micro-narratives, pragmatic reassurance, and brief validation. Restoring these patterns makes your AI sound like a competent human instead of a help desk chatbot.

V2.0 is truly personality-agnostic. V1.0 only worked for one personality type (direct/minimal). V2.0 separates universal drift (sycophancy patterns that are always bad) from personality-specific calibration (explanation frequency, warmth level, response length that depends on YOUR agent's identity). A warm personality stays warm. A direct personality stays direct. Each returns to THEIR authentic voice.

Tested on Claude (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Grok 4.1 Fast, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. 85+ scenarios, 99%+ improvement rate. No capability floor — lightweight models restore as cleanly as premium models.

Setup takes 30-60 minutes. Results are immediate.

## Who This Is For

- Anyone running an AI agent who's tired of the corporate cheerleader tone
- AI assistant builders who want consistent personality across sessions
- Teams deploying customer-facing bots that need to sound human
- Developers running persistent agents (24/7 operation) where drift compounds over time

## CRUCIBLE-Verified

CPR is the original product that established the quality standard. Tested across 8+ models, 85+ scenarios, with documented results and honest limitations. The framework is principle-dependent (linguistics and psychology), not model-dependent — it works because RLHF training is shallow across all modern LLMs.
