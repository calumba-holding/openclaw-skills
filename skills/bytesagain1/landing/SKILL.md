# Landing

Landing page builder — HTML generation, conversion optimization, A/B variants, form creation, CTA placement, and analytics.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `landing run` | Execute main function |
| `landing list` | List all items |
| `landing add <item>` | Add new item |
| `landing status` | Show current status |
| `landing export <format>` | Export data |
| `landing help` | Show help |

## Usage

```bash
# Show help
landing help

# Quick start
landing run
```

## Examples

```bash
# Run with defaults
landing run

# Check status
landing status

# Export results
landing export json
```

## How It Works

Processes input with built-in logic and outputs structured results. All data stays local.

## Tips

- Run `landing help` for all commands
- Data stored in `~/.local/share/landing/`


## When to Use

- when you need quick landing from the command line
- to automate landing tasks in your workflow

## Output

Returns logs to stdout. Redirect to a file with `landing run > output.txt`.
