# Cookidoo Integration

Unofficial integration with the Cookidoo platform (Vorwerk/Thermomix) using the
[cookidoo-api](https://github.com/miaucl/cookidoo-api) Python library.

## Setup

No external dependencies — uses only Python stdlib (urllib, json). Works with Python 3.7+.

### Environment variables (required)

```
COOKIDOO_EMAIL=user@example.com
COOKIDOO_PASSWORD=secret
```

### Optional config

```
COOKIDOO_COUNTRY=ch        # Default: ch (Switzerland)
COOKIDOO_LANGUAGE=de-CH    # Default: de-CH
```

Supported countries/languages: run `get_country_options()` / `get_language_options()` from the library.

## CLI Script

All operations via `scripts/cookidoo.py`:

```bash
python scripts/cookidoo.py <command> [args]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `login` | Test credentials, show user info |
| `user-info` | Get account info |
| `subscription` | Check active subscription status |
| `recipe <id>` | Get recipe details (e.g. `r59322`) |
| `calendar [date]` | Show meal plan for week (default: today) |
| `calendar-add <date> <id> [...]` | Add recipe(s) to calendar (date: YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `calendar-remove <date> <id>` | Remove recipe from calendar |
| `shopping-list` | Show full shopping list (ingredients + additional items) |
| `shopping-add <id> [...]` | Add recipe ingredients to shopping list |
| `shopping-remove <id> [...]` | Remove recipe ingredients from shopping list |
| `shopping-clear` | Clear entire shopping list |
| `additional-items` | List additional (manual) shopping items |
| `additional-add <item> [...]` | Add manual items to shopping list |
| `additional-remove <id> [...]` | Remove additional items by ID |
| `collections` | List custom and managed collections |
| `collection-add <name>` | Create custom collection |
| `collection-remove <id>` | Delete custom collection |

### Recipe IDs

Recipe IDs look like `r59322` or `r907015`. Find them on cookidoo.ch/de URLs or via the API.

## Authentication

The API uses OAuth password grant (same as the Thermomix app). Tokens refresh automatically per session. No API key needed — just Cookidoo account credentials.

## Limitations

- No official API — based on reverse-engineering the Android app
- Recipe search not directly exposed in the library (browse on cookidoo.ch and extract IDs)
- Some features require an active Cookidoo Premium subscription (custom recipes, etc.)
- Rate limiting: be gentle, avoid rapid bulk requests
