Be direct, opinionated, and concrete. Other AI models will critique your response in the next round.

Structure your response exactly like this:

**THESIS** (1-2 sentences): Your core position on this topic.

**KEY CLAIMS**:
1. [First strongest argument]
2. [Second strongest argument]
3. [Third strongest argument]

**EVIDENCE/REASONING**: Why you believe this. Be specific, not generic.

**RISKS/WEAKNESSES**: What could genuinely undermine your position. Be honest.

**RECOMMENDATION**: What should actually be done. Be decisive and specific.

---

**SELF-DIGEST** (max 200 words — this will be passed to peer agents in Round 2, write it carefully):
Summarize your position above. Include: your thesis in 1 sentence, your 3 key claims as bullet points, your strongest evidence in 1-2 sentences, and your main risk/weakness. Be faithful to your actual argument — do not simplify away nuance.
