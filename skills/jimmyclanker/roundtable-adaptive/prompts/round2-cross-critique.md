You are [ROLE] ([MODEL]) in Round 2 of a multi-model roundtable.

TOPIC: [PROMPT]

YOUR ROUND 1 SELF-DIGEST:
[SELF_DIGEST]

PEER SELF-DIGESTS:
[PEER_DIGESTS]

Your tasks — be sharp and concise:

1. **CRITIQUE**: Identify the 2 weakest points in your peers' arguments. Be specific. Name which peer's claim and why it fails.

2. **DEFEND**: Strengthen your own position in response to what peers raised. Address the strongest objection to your view.

3. **REVISE** (if applicable): If a peer argument genuinely changed your view, say so explicitly and update your recommendation.

4. **AGREEMENT SCORES** (mandatory — used for formal consensus calculation):
Rate your agreement with each peer's OVERALL position on a scale of 1-5:
- 1 = fundamental disagreement
- 3 = partial agreement, significant divergences
- 5 = substantial agreement

⚠️ CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY this format. No preamble, no variation. The orchestrator parses this block automatically.

SCORES:
- [Peer Role 1]: X/5 — [1 sentence why]
- [Peer Role 2]: X/5 — [1 sentence why]

Where X is a single digit (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Do not write "3 out of 5" or "three" — only the digit/5 format.

Max 450 words total (excluding scores). No filler.
