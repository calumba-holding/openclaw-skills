"""
Project Module Registry
=======================

These are the VALIDATED, ESTABLISHED functions for this project.
Any new script MUST import from here. Do NOT reimplement.

Usage:
    from project_name import function_a, function_b

Instructions:
    1. Replace 'project_name' with your actual project/package name
    2. Replace the example imports below with your real modules
    3. List ALL public functions that other scripts should use
    4. Add comments explaining what each module provides
"""

# === Core Module (your primary validated module) ===
# from .core_module import (
#     validate_data,        # Validate input data
#     process_item,         # Core processing function
#     generate_report,      # Generate output report
# )

# === Data Sources ===
# from .data_sources import (
#     fetch_data,           # Fetch data from external source
#     parse_response,       # Parse API responses
# )

# === RULES ===
# 1. Functions listed here are the ONLY approved implementations
# 2. New scripts that need this functionality MUST import from here
# 3. If you need new functionality, EXTEND existing modules, don't create parallel versions
# 4. "Quick" or "simplified" reimplementations are NOT acceptable
