## Marketing Copy

### Short Description (for listings)

"Mechanical enforcement for AI agents. Prevents bypass patterns, secret leaks, deployment gaps, and ensures knowledge compounds across projects. 100% reliable through code hooks, not markdown rules."

### Long Description

"Agent Guardrails provides mechanical enforcement tools that BLOCK common AI agent failures at the code level, not through unreliable markdown rules.

**Problem:** AI agents forget important steps, bypass standards, and lose knowledge between projects.

**Solution:** Git hooks and automated checks that make it impossible to commit without verification.

**4 Failure Modes Prevented:**
1. Reimplementation (bypass patterns)
2. Hardcoded secrets  
3. Deployment gaps (code works but not wired to production)
4. Skill update gaps (improvements don't flow back to shared skills)

**Reliability:** 100% through code enforcement vs 40-50% through documentation.

**One-command install:** Works with any project. Self-hosting feedback loop ensures continuous improvement."

### Use Cases

- **For solo developers:** Never forget deployment steps again
- **For teams:** Enforce standards mechanically, not through code reviews
- **For AI agent developers:** Prevent common failure modes at the source
- **For open source:** Ensure improvements compound across projects

### Screenshots/Demos

1. Pre-commit hook blocking a bypass pattern
2. Deployment check catching missing integration
3. Skill update task being auto-created
4. Before/after of enforcement pyramid

## Social Media Announcement

### Twitter Thread
See X_THREAD.md for full 15-tweet thread.

### LinkedIn Post
"After 3 days debugging why our AI agent kept 'forgetting' deployment steps, we realized the problem wasn't the agent — it was our enforcement strategy.

We built Agent Guardrails: mechanical enforcement that makes it impossible to forget.

Key insight: Markdown rules = 40% reliable. Git hooks = 100% reliable.

### Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/LangChain, r/LocalLLaMA)

Title: "Built mechanical enforcement for AI agents after 3-day deployment gap bug"

Body:
"TL;DR: If you work with AI agents, you've probably faced this: agent builds perfect code, marks task 'done,' but forgets to connect it to production. We built Agent Guardrails to mechanically prevent this.

[Story of the problem]
[The 5-layer enforcement hierarchy we discovered]
[How we solved it with git hooks]

Would love feedback from anyone else facing similar issues!"
