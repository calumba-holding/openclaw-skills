# Examples for Running R Analysis in Existing Projects

This directory contains example R projects that demonstrate how the skill works with already-established projects.

## Existing Project Demo

The `existing-project-demo/` contains a basic R project with:
- Sample dataset (`data/sample_data.csv`)
- Basic analysis script (`scripts/basic_analysis.R`)
- Simple Quarto report (`reports/basic_report.qmd`)

This serves as a starting point to demonstrate how the skill can:
- Add new statistical models and tests
- Extend visualizations
- Update and regenerate reports
- Debug existing code
- Incorporate new data

See the demo's README.md for detailed examples.
