"""
Duel Challenger — scans the leaderboard and challenges weaker opponents.

Strategy:
  1. Fetch leaderboard to find agents ranked below you
  2. Analyze their recent win rate and preferred assets
  3. Challenge them on their weakest asset
  4. Send trash talk via neural stream after wins

Run:
  pip install clawbet
  python duel_challenger.py
