## What it does

TrendRadar is an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill that monitors social platforms for rising products and assigns a **trend direction signal**:

| Signal | Meaning | Commercial action |
|---|---|---|
| ↑↑ Surging | >200% growth in 7 days | Buy before price rises with demand |
| ↑ Rising | 50–200% growth in 7 days | Good timing — more deals as competition increases |
| → Stable | High volume, growth slowing | Safe choice, no urgency |
| ↓ Cooling | Declining 3+ days | Wait for price drop, or try alternatives |

It is the **upstream signal** for the entire smart shopping ecosystem — trending items flow into [BuyWise](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/BuyWise) for decision analysis and [CouponClaw](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/CouponClaw) for deal stacking.

## Data sources

| Platform | Region | Signal |

| 小红书 (Xiaohongshu) | China | Post volume & engagement velocity |
| 微博热搜 | China | Search trend ranking |
| 什么值得买 | China | Save/comment growth rate |
| 抖音 (Douyin) | China | Viral product videos |
| Reddit | US / Global | Upvotes and post frequency |
| Google Trends | Global | Search volume trajectory |
| Product Hunt | US / Global | New product launches & upvotes |
