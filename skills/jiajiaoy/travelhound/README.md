## What it does

TravelHound is an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill that does for flights and hotels what [BuyWise](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/BuyWise) does for products: compares real prices across platforms, checks whether now is the right time to book, finds promo codes, and gives you a clear verdict.

**Flight comparison** — Google Flights + Skyscanner + Kayak + Trip.com, with Kayak's *Buy now / Wait* forecast  
**Hotel comparison** — Booking.com + Agoda + Hotels.com + Trip.com, with OTA coupon stacking  
**Full trip planner** — flights + hotels in one report with total budget estimate  
**Destination intelligence** — visa requirements, exchange rate trend, safety advisories, latest news  
**OTA coupon stacking** — calls [CouponClaw](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/CouponClaw) to find promo codes for Booking.com, Agoda, Trip.com  
**News check** — calls [NewsToday](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/NewsToday) for destination-relevant headlines (political situation, weather, local events)
