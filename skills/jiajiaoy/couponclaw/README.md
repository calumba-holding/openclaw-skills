## What it does

CouponClaw is an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill that runs a **3-layer savings strategy** on any product or store:

1. **Layer 1 — Coupon codes**: real-time browser search across region-specific coupon sites
2. **Layer 2 — Cashback stacking**: compares rates across Rakuten, TopCashback, ShopBack, 返利网 — and checks if they stack with the coupon
3. **Layer 3 — DTC brand check**: detects first-order discounts and newsletter signup offers on brand official sites

Also generates a daily deals briefing surfacing the hottest community-verified deals from smzdm, Slickdeals, HotUKDeals, OzBargain, and ShopBack each morning.
