## What it does

BuyWise is an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill that answers the question you ask before every purchase: *is this actually a good deal?*

It navigates real product pages using your AI's browser tool — no fabricated prices — and returns a verdict with evidence.

**Price comparison** — Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Temu, JD, Taobao, Tmall, smzdm in one report  
**Fake discount detection** — checks CamelCamelCamel and smzdm price history to expose "inflate then discount" tactics  
**Review analysis** — extracts top strengths, complaints, who it's for, and red flags  
**Alternatives** — recommends 2-3 better-value options with price ranges  
**Buy timing** — 🟢 Buy now / 🟡 Wait / 🔴 Skip verdict with reasoning  
**Coupon stacking** — hands off to [CouponClaw](https://github.com/jiajiaoy/CouponClaw) to stack promo codes + cashback on confirmed buys
