### Visa Category Selection
When a user describes a role or candidate, recommend the right visa path:

| Category | Use Case | Processing | Employer Cost |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| H-1B | Specialty occupation (BS+ required) | 3-6 months (15 days premium) | $5,000-$12,000 |
| L-1A | Intracompany executive/manager | 2-5 months (15 days premium) | $4,000-$8,000 |
| L-1B | Intracompany specialized knowledge | 2-5 months (15 days premium) | $4,000-$8,000 |
| O-1A | Extraordinary ability (sciences/business) | 2-4 months (15 days premium) | $6,000-$15,000 |
| O-1B | Extraordinary ability (arts) | 2-4 months (15 days premium) | $6,000-$15,000 |

### H-1B Lottery Strategy
- **Cap**: 65,000 regular + 20,000 US master's
- **Registration**: March each year, $215 per beneficiary (2026)
- **Selection rate**: ~25-30% (FY2025 data)
- **Cap-exempt employers**: Universities, nonprofits affiliated with universities, government research orgs
- **Multiple registration ban**: One registration per beneficiary per sponsor (USCIS crackdown FY2025+)
- **Backup strategies**: O-1A (no cap), L-1 (no cap), TN (no cap), Day-1 CPT (risky), Canada/UK office + L-1 later

### Prevailing Wage & LCA Compliance
For H-1B, H-1B1, E-3 positions:
1. **Prevailing wage determination** from DOL (OFLC Online Wage Library or individual PWD request)
2. **LCA posting**: 10 business days at worksite (physical or electronic)
3. **Public access file**: Maintain for each LCA (wage rate, actual wage, working conditions)
4. **Wage levels**:
   - Level 1: Entry (17th percentile)
   - Level 2: Qualified (34th percentile)
   - Level 3: Experienced (50th percentile)
   - Level 4: Fully competent (67th percentile)
5. **DOL audit risk**: Misclassifying Level 1 for senior roles is #1 violation

### I-9 Compliance & Audit Readiness
**Section 1** — Employee completes by first day of work
**Section 2** — Employer completes within 3 business days of start
**Section 3** — Reverification for expiring work authorization

Common violations (ranked by frequency):
| Violation | ICE Fine (per I-9) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Substantive/uncorrected technical | $272-$2,701 |
| Knowingly hire unauthorized | $676-$5,404 (first offense) |
| Pattern/practice | $4,055-$27,018 + criminal |
| Document abuse/discrimination | $252-$2,507 |

**Audit prep checklist**:
- [ ] All I-9s complete and accessible (retain 3 years from hire or 1 year from termination, whichever later)
- [ ] No over-documentation (don't request specific documents)
- [ ] E-Verify cases closed properly (mandatory for federal contractors, some states)
- [ ] Reverification tracked before expiration dates
- [ ] Receipts properly handled (90-day rule)
- [ ] Remote I-9 procedures documented (if using authorized alternative)

### PERM / Green Card Employer Compliance
For EB-2 and EB-3 employer-sponsored green cards:
1. **Prevailing wage request** (6-12 months processing)
2. **Recruitment**: 30-day mandatory ads — 2 Sunday newspapers + SWA job order + 3 additional (from 10 options)
3. **Recruitment report**: Document all US applicants, reasons for rejection (must be lawful, job-related)
4. **Supervised recruitment**: For college/university teachers
5. **Audit risk factors**: Prior layoffs within 6 months, high salary offers, unusual job requirements
6. **Retention**: Keep recruitment records 5 years from filing or audit conclusion

**Priority date backlogs** (check Visa Bulletin monthly):
- EB-1: Current for most countries (except India/China 2-5 year wait)
- EB-2: India backlog 10+ years, China 3-5 years
- EB-3: India backlog 10+ years, China 2-4 years
- Strategy: EB-1C for executives, EB-2 NIW (no employer needed), EB-1A (extraordinary ability)

### Compliance Calendar
| Month | Action |
|-------|--------|
| January | Review H-1B lottery strategy, identify candidates |
| February | Prepare H-1B registrations, gather documents |
| March | H-1B electronic registration window |
| April | File selected H-1B petitions (Oct 1 start) |

| Quarterly | E-Verify case review and closure |
| Ongoing | Monitor Visa Bulletin for priority date movement |

### Worksite Enforcement Trends
- **ICE I-9 audits**: 6,000+ annually (trend increasing)
- **HSI investigations**: Focus on repeat violators and industries (construction, food processing, hospitality)
- **State enforcement**: CA, IL, NY limit employer cooperation; TX, FL increase state-level enforcement
- **Remote work**: USCIS requires amended petitions for material worksite changes (H-1B)
