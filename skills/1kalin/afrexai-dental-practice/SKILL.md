## Production Benchmarks (per provider/day)

| Metric | Solo GP | GP w/Hygienist | Specialist |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Daily production target | $2,500-$3,500 | $4,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000+ |

| Collection rate target | ≥98% | ≥98% | ≥95% |
| Overhead target | ≤60% | ≤55% | ≤50% |
| Hygiene production % | N/A | 25-33% of total | N/A |

## Overhead Breakdown Targets

| Category | % of Collections | Red Flag If |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Staff wages (all) | 25-28% | >30% |
| Lab fees | 8-10% | >12% |

## Schedule Optimization

### Block Scheduling Template
```
7:00-8:00   Emergency/same-day hold (fill by 2pm prior day or release)
8:00-10:00  HIGH production block (crowns, implants, endo)
10:00-11:00 Medium production (composites, SRP)
11:00-12:00 Hygiene checks + consults
12:00-1:00  Lunch (use for lab calls, insurance follow-up)
1:00-3:00   HIGH production block
3:00-4:00   Medium production + new patient exams
4:00-5:00   Hygiene checks + same-day treatment
```

### No-Show Reduction Protocol
1. **48-hour confirmation** — text + email (automated)
2. **24-hour confirmation** — text with 1-tap confirm/reschedule link
3. **2-hour reminder** — text only
4. **No-show policy**: After 2 no-shows → require deposit for future appointments
5. **Quick-fill list**: Maintain list of patients wanting earlier appointments
6. **Target**: <5% no-show rate (industry avg: 10-15%)

### Same-Day Treatment Acceptance
- Present treatment plan chairside with visual aids (intraoral camera photos)
- Quote insurance estimate BEFORE patient leaves
- Offer same-day completion for single-surface restorations
- Target: 85%+ case acceptance rate (industry avg: 50-60%)

## Insurance & Billing

### Top 10 CDT Codes (by frequency)

|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| D0120 | Periodic oral eval | $55-$75 | Every recall visit |
| D0274 | Bitewings (4 films) | $65-$90 | Annual or semi-annual |
| D0330 | Panoramic radiograph | $120-$175 | Every 3-5 years |
| D1110 | Adult prophylaxis | $95-$140 | Hygiene bread-and-butter |
| D4341 | SRP per quadrant | $225-$325 | Perio — high production |
| D2392 | Composite 2-surface | $200-$280 | Most common restoration |
| D2750 | Crown (porcelain/ceramic) | $1,100-$1,500 | Highest single-unit revenue |

| D3330 | Molar endo (RCT) | $900-$1,300 | Keep in-house if possible |

### Insurance Optimization
- **Verify benefits** before EVERY appointment (automate with Dental Intel, Weave, or similar)
- **Pre-authorize** all treatment >$500
- **Appeal every denial** — 50% of dental claim denials are overturned on first appeal
- **Track aging AR weekly**: 0-30 days (healthy), 31-60 (follow up), 61-90 (escalate), 90+ (collections)
- **UCR fee update**: Review fees annually against ADA Survey of Dental Fees + local market
- **Write-off analysis**: If write-offs >15% of production, renegotiate or drop worst PPO plans

### PPO Plan Evaluation
Drop a PPO plan when:
- Reimbursement <65% of UCR for top 20 codes
- Plan represents <5% of patient base
- Cost to participate (fee reduction) exceeds revenue from plan patients
- Write-offs from plan >$50K/year without proportional patient volume

## When the user asks for help

1. Start with their biggest pain point (usually production, collections, or no-shows)
2. Pull the relevant benchmarks and compare to their numbers
3. Give specific, actionable steps — not general advice
4. Reference CDT codes, fee schedules, and compliance requirements by name
5. Always check: are they tracking the KPIs above? If not, start there
