## Phase 1: RevOps Assessment & Foundation

### Revenue Architecture Audit

Before optimizing, understand the current state.

```yaml
# revops-audit.yaml

arr_current: ""
arr_target: ""
stage: ""  # pre-revenue | <$1M | $1-5M | $5-20M | $20M+
model: ""  # PLG | sales-led | hybrid | marketplace
avg_deal_size: ""
sales_cycle_days: ""
team_size:
  marketing: 0
  sales: 0
  cs: 0
  revops: 0

tech_stack:
  crm: ""  # HubSpot | Salesforce | Pipedrive | none
  marketing_automation: ""
  cs_platform: ""
  billing: ""  # Stripe | Chargebee | Zuora
  data_warehouse: ""
  bi_tool: ""

current_pain:
  - ""  # e.g., "no single source of truth for pipeline"
  - ""  # e.g., "marketing and sales disagree on lead quality"
```

### RevOps Maturity Model (Score 1-5 per dimension)

| Dimension | 1 (Ad Hoc) | 3 (Defined) | 5 (Optimized) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Data** | Spreadsheets, no single source | CRM is system of record, basic hygiene | Unified data model, automated enrichment, 95%+ accuracy |
| **Process** | Tribal knowledge, inconsistent | Documented playbooks, SLAs exist | Automated workflows, continuous optimization |
| **Technology** | Disconnected tools, manual entry | Integrated stack, some automation | Unified platform, AI-assisted, real-time |
| **Analytics** | Lagging indicators only | Leading + lagging, weekly reviews | Predictive models, automated alerts, cohort analysis |
| **Alignment** | Silos, blame culture | Shared definitions, joint meetings | Unified funnel ownership, shared comp incentives |
| **Enablement** | No onboarding, learn by doing | Playbooks exist, quarterly training | Continuous enablement, data-driven coaching |

**Scoring:**
- 6-12: Foundation stage — focus on data and definitions first
- 13-20: Building stage — standardize processes, integrate tools
- 21-25: Scaling stage — automate, predict, optimize
- 26-30: World-class — continuous improvement, AI-driven

## Phase 2: Revenue Data Architecture

### Single Source of Truth Design

Every RevOps transformation starts with clean, unified data.

#### Object Model

```
Account (company)
├── Contacts (people)
├── Opportunities (deals)
│   ├── Line Items (products/SKUs)
│   ├── Activities (emails, calls, meetings)
│   └── Stage History (timestamp per stage)
├── Subscriptions (active contracts)
│   ├── Usage Data (if usage-based)
│   └── Renewal Schedule
└── Support Tickets
    └── CSAT Scores
```

#### Required Fields by Object

**Account:**
- Industry, employee count, ARR band, ICP tier (A/B/C/D), health score, owner, territory
- Enrichment: technographics, funding stage, growth signals

**Contact:**
- Role, seniority, buyer persona, engagement score, last activity date, opted-in channels
- Required for attribution: original source, most recent source

**Opportunity:**
- Amount, close date, stage, forecast category, MEDDPICC score, created date, source campaign
- Required for velocity: stage entry dates (all stages)

#### Data Hygiene Rules

| Rule | Frequency | Owner | Threshold |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Duplicate accounts | Weekly | RevOps | <2% duplicate rate |
| Missing fields on open opps | Daily | Sales managers | 100% completion |
| Stale opportunities (no activity 14d+) | Daily | AE owner | Flag + auto-alert |
| Contact bounce rate | Monthly | Marketing | <5% |
| Lead-to-account matching | Real-time | Automation | 95%+ match rate |
| Closed-lost reason populated | On close | AE | 100% required |

### Attribution Model Selection

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **First touch** | Demand gen teams | Simple, rewards awareness | Ignores nurture |
| **Last touch** | Sales orgs | Simple, rewards conversion | Ignores awareness |
| **Linear** | Small teams | Fair distribution | No signal on what works |
| **U-shaped** | B2B mid-market | Weights first + lead creation | Still arbitrary |
| **W-shaped** | B2B enterprise | Adds opp creation weight | Complex to implement |
| **Full-path** | Mature RevOps | Most complete picture | Requires good data |
| **Data-driven** | $20M+ ARR | ML-based, most accurate | Needs volume + data warehouse |

**Decision rule:** Start with U-shaped. Move to W-shaped when you have opp creation tracking. Move to data-driven when you have 500+ closed-won deals/year.

## Phase 3: Funnel Architecture & Definitions

### Universal Funnel Stages

Every team MUST agree on these definitions. No exceptions.

```yaml
# funnel-definitions.yaml
stages:
  - name: "Visitor"
    definition: "Anonymous website session"
    owner: "Marketing"
    
  - name: "Known"
    definition: "Identified by email (form fill, content download, event)"
    owner: "Marketing"
    
  - name: "MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)"
    definition: "Meets minimum engagement threshold (score >= 50) AND fits ICP criteria"
    owner: "Marketing"
    criteria:
      behavioral: "Downloaded 2+ assets OR attended webinar OR visited pricing page 2x in 7 days"
      firmographic: "Matches ICP (right industry, size, geo)"
    sla: "Routed to SDR within 5 minutes"
    
  - name: "SAL (Sales Accepted Lead)"
    definition: "SDR confirms lead is real, reachable, and worth pursuing"
    owner: "SDR"
    criteria: "Valid contact info, responded to outreach, confirmed fit"
    sla: "Accept or reject within 4 business hours"
    rejection_reasons:
      - "Bad contact info"
      - "Not decision maker"
      - "Wrong ICP"
      - "Duplicate"
      - "Competitor"
    
  - name: "SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)"
    definition: "Discovery completed, BANT confirmed, has budget/authority/need/timeline"
    owner: "SDR → AE handoff"
    criteria: "BANT score >= 3/4, discovery call completed"
    sla: "AE must have first meeting within 48 hours of handoff"
    
  - name: "Opportunity Created"
    definition: "AE confirms deal is real, enters in CRM with amount and close date"
    owner: "AE"
    required_fields: "Amount, close date, stage, decision maker identified, next step"
    
  - name: "Proposal/Negotiation"
    definition: "Pricing presented, contract in review"
    owner: "AE"
    
  - name: "Closed Won"
    definition: "Contract signed, payment terms agreed"
    owner: "AE → CS handoff"
    sla: "CS kickoff within 48 hours"
    
  - name: "Closed Lost"
    definition: "Deal dead — reason MUST be captured"
    owner: "AE"
    required: "Primary loss reason, competitor (if applicable), notes"
```

### Conversion Rate Benchmarks (B2B SaaS)

| Stage Transition | Bottom 25% | Median | Top 25% | World-Class |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Visitor → Known | <1% | 2-3% | 4-6% | 8%+ |
| Known → MQL | <5% | 8-12% | 15-20% | 25%+ |
| MQL → SAL | <40% | 50-60% | 70-80% | 85%+ |
| SAL → SQL | <30% | 40-50% | 55-65% | 70%+ |
| SQL → Opp Created | <50% | 60-70% | 75-85% | 90%+ |
| Opp → Closed Won | <15% | 20-25% | 30-40% | 45%+ |
| **Full funnel** (MQL→CW) | <2% | 3-5% | 6-10% | 12%+ |

**Diagnostic rule:** If any stage conversion is bottom 25%, that's your bottleneck. Fix it before optimizing anything else.

### Lead Scoring Model

```yaml
# lead-scoring.yaml
behavioral_signals:  # Max 60 points
  - action: "Visited pricing page"
    points: 15
    decay: "5 points/week after 14 days"
  - action: "Downloaded whitepaper/ebook"
    points: 10
  - action: "Attended webinar"
    points: 12
  - action: "Requested demo"
    points: 25
  - action: "Opened 3+ emails in 7 days"
    points: 8
  - action: "Visited 5+ pages in session"
    points: 10
  - action: "Returned to site within 7 days"
    points: 8
  - action: "Engaged with chatbot"
    points: 5

    points: -30
  - signal: "Unsubscribed from emails"
    points: -20
  - signal: "No activity in 30 days"
    points: -15
```

---

## Phase 4: Pipeline Management

### Pipeline Coverage Model

```
Required pipeline = Quota ÷ Win Rate × Coverage Multiple

Coverage Multiple by stage:
- $1M quota, 25% win rate = need $4M pipeline (4x)
- Adjust by deal age:
  - Fresh (<30 days): count at 100%
  - Aging (30-60 days past expected close): count at 50%
  - Stale (60+ days past): count at 25%
```

**Healthy Pipeline Ratios:**

| Metric | Minimum | Healthy | Optimal |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Pipeline coverage (total) | 3x | 3.5-4x | 4-5x |
| Pipeline coverage (weighted) | 1.5x | 2-2.5x | 3x |
| New pipeline created/month | 1x quota | 1.5x quota | 2x quota |
| Deals in negotiation stage | 15-20% of pipe | 25-30% | 35%+ |

### Deal Velocity Formula

```
Sales Velocity = (# Opportunities × Win Rate × Average Deal Size) ÷ Sales Cycle Length

Example:
(50 opps × 25% × $30,000) ÷ 60 days = $6,250/day revenue velocity

To increase velocity, improve ANY of:
1. More opportunities (marketing/SDR efficiency)
2. Higher win rate (sales enablement/qualification)
3. Larger deals (pricing/packaging/expansion)
4. Shorter cycles (process optimization/champion enablement)
```

### Pipeline Review Cadence

```yaml
# pipeline-review-cadence.yaml
daily:
  who: "AE self-review"
  duration: "15 min"
  focus: "Next steps on active deals, stale deal cleanup"
  
weekly:
  who: "Manager + AE 1:1"
  duration: "30 min"
  focus: "Top 5 deals deep-dive, forecast accuracy, next week commits"
  template: |
    ## Weekly Pipeline Review — [AE Name] — [Date]
    
    ### Forecast
    - Commit: $[X] ([N] deals)
    - Best case: $[X] ([N] deals)
    - Change from last week: +/- $[X]
    
    ### Top 5 Deals
    | Deal | Amount | Stage | Next Step | Risk | Close Date |
    |------|--------|-------|-----------|------|------------|
    
    ### Pipeline Health
    - Coverage: [X]x vs [X]x target
    - New pipe created this week: $[X]
    - Deals pushed: [N] ($[X])
    - Deals lost: [N] ($[X]) — reasons: [...]
    
    ### Actions
    1. [...]

monthly:
  who: "CRO/VP + all managers"
  duration: "60 min"
  focus: "Forecast call, pipeline trends, process gaps"
  
quarterly:
  who: "RevOps + leadership"
  duration: "90 min"
  focus: "Funnel health, conversion trends, capacity planning, process changes"
```

### Forecast Categories

| Category | Definition | Confidence | Include in Forecast? |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Commit** | Verbal/written agreement, contract in process | 90%+ | Yes — base forecast |
| **Best Case** | Strong signals, high engagement, but not committed | 60-89% | Yes — upside |
| **Pipeline** | Qualified, in active sales cycle | 20-59% | Weighted only |
| **Upside** | Early stage, unqualified, or long-shot | <20% | No |
| **Omitted** | Not closing this period | 0% | No |

**Forecast accuracy target:** MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) < 15%

```
MAPE = |Actual - Forecast| ÷ Actual × 100

Grading:
- <10%: Excellent — trust the forecast
- 10-15%: Good — minor calibration needed
- 15-25%: Needs work — review qualification criteria
- >25%: Broken — rebuild forecast methodology
```

## Phase 5: Revenue Metrics Dashboard

### The RevOps Metric Stack

#### Tier 1: Board Metrics (Monthly)

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark (B2B SaaS) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **ARR** | Sum of all active annual contract values | Growth rate context-dependent |

#### Tier 2: Operating Metrics (Weekly)

| Metric | Owner | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| MQL volume | Marketing | [Set from model] |
| MQL → SQL conversion | SDR team | >40% |
| SQL → Opp conversion | AE team | >60% |

## Phase 6: GTM Efficiency & Unit Economics

### GTM Efficiency by ACV Tier

| ACV | Primary Motion | Typical CAC | Target Payback | S&M % of Revenue |
|-----|---------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| <$1K | Self-serve / PLG | <$500 | <3 months | <30% |
| $1-10K | Inside sales + PLG | $2-5K | <6 months | 30-50% |
| $10-50K | Inside sales | $10-25K | <12 months | 40-60% |
| $50-100K | Field sales | $30-60K | <18 months | 50-70% |
| $100K+ | Enterprise field | $50-150K+ | <24 months | 40-60% |

### Capacity Model

```
Required AEs = Revenue Target ÷ (Quota × Expected Attainment)

Example:
$5M new ARR target ÷ ($600K quota × 70% attainment) = 12 AEs needed

Ramp schedule:
- Month 1-2: 0% productivity (onboarding)
- Month 3: 25% productivity
- Month 4-5: 50% productivity  
- Month 6+: 100% productivity (fully ramped)

So 12 AEs needed at full ramp = hire 14-15 to account for ramp + attrition
```

### Rep Productivity Analysis

```yaml
# rep-scorecard.yaml

## Phase 7: Marketing-Sales Alignment (SLA Framework)

### Marketing → Sales SLA

```yaml
# marketing-sla.yaml
commitment:
  mql_volume: "[N] MQLs per month"
  mql_quality: "MQL-to-SQL rate >= [X]%"
  lead_data_completeness: "100% of required fields populated"
  
delivery:
  routing: "MQLs routed to correct SDR within 5 minutes"
  context: "Lead source, engagement history, and score visible in CRM"
  
reporting:
  frequency: "Weekly MQL report by source, score band, and ICP tier"
  review: "Monthly alignment meeting with sales leadership"
```

### Sales → Marketing SLA

```yaml
# sales-sla.yaml
commitment:
  response_time: "Contact MQL within 4 business hours"
  follow_up: "Minimum 6-touch sequence over 14 days before rejecting"
  feedback: "Rejection reason provided within 48 hours"
  
delivery:
  crm_hygiene: "All MQLs dispositioned within 48 hours (accepted/rejected)"
  win_loss: "Closed-lost reason + competitor captured on every deal"
  
reporting:
  frequency: "Weekly SAL/SQL report with rejection reasons"
  review: "Monthly alignment meeting with marketing leadership"
```

### Sales → CS Handoff SLA

```yaml
# cs-handoff-sla.yaml
trigger: "Contract signed"
sales_responsibilities:
  - "Complete handoff document within 24 hours"
  - "Intro email to CS owner within 24 hours"
  - "Joint kickoff call within 5 business days"
  
handoff_document:
  - "Customer goals and success criteria"
  - "Technical requirements discussed"
  - "Key stakeholders and champions"
  - "Pricing/discount details and renewal date"
  - "Risks identified during sales process"
  - "Competitive alternatives considered"
  
cs_responsibilities:
  - "Acknowledge handoff within 4 hours"
  - "Send welcome email within 24 hours"
  - "Schedule onboarding kickoff within 48 hours"
```

## Phase 8: Revenue Process Automation

### Automation Priority Stack

| Process | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Lead routing | High — speed kills | Low | P0 — Do first |
| Lead scoring | High — quality focus | Medium | P0 |
| Stage progression alerts | Medium — pipeline hygiene | Low | P1 |
| Renewal reminders (90/60/30 day) | High — retention | Low | P1 |
| Expansion signal alerts | High — NRR | Medium | P1 |
| Forecast roll-up | Medium — accuracy | Medium | P2 |
| Activity logging | Medium — data quality | Medium | P2 |
| Win/loss analysis compilation | Medium — learning | High | P2 |
| Comp calculation | Medium — motivation | High | P3 |
| Territory assignment | Low (unless scaling fast) | High | P3 |

### Lead Routing Logic

```yaml
# lead-routing.yaml
rules:
  - name: "Enterprise (500+ employees)"
    condition: "company_size >= 500 AND icp_tier IN ['A', 'B']"
    route_to: "enterprise_ae_round_robin"
    sla: "5 minutes"
    
  - name: "Mid-market (50-499)"
    condition: "company_size BETWEEN 50 AND 499"
    route_to: "mm_sdr_round_robin"
    sla: "5 minutes"
    
  - name: "SMB (<50)"
    condition: "company_size < 50 AND lead_score >= 50"
    route_to: "smb_sdr_round_robin"
    sla: "15 minutes"
    
  - name: "Low score"
    condition: "lead_score < 50"
    route_to: "nurture_campaign"
    sla: "N/A — automated nurture"
    
  - name: "Named account"
    condition: "account IN named_account_list"
    route_to: "assigned_ae_direct"
    sla: "Immediate notification"
    
fallback: "marketing_ops_queue"
escalation: "If no action in 30 minutes, re-route to manager"
```

### Expansion Signal Detection

```yaml
# expansion-signals.yaml
usage_signals:
  - signal: "Approaching seat/usage limit (>80%)"
    action: "Alert CS + AE, send upgrade nudge"
    urgency: "High"
  - signal: "New department/team using product"
    action: "Alert AE for cross-sell conversation"
    urgency: "Medium"
  - signal: "API usage growing >20% MoM"
    action: "Log for QBR, prepare enterprise tier pitch"
    urgency: "Medium"

engagement_signals:
  - signal: "Executive attended webinar"
    action: "Alert AE, potential champion expansion"
    urgency: "High"
  - signal: "Support ticket from new department"
    action: "Alert CS, new user group emerging"
    urgency: "Medium"

lifecycle_signals:
  - signal: "Renewal in 90 days + healthy NPS"
    action: "Initiate renewal + expansion conversation"
    urgency: "High"
  - signal: "12 months since last price increase"
    action: "Flag for pricing review at renewal"
    urgency: "Low"
```

## Phase 9: Compensation & Territory Design

### Comp Plan Architecture

| Role | Base:Variable | OTE Range | Quota Multiple |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| SDR | 70:30 | $55-85K | Pipeline generated = 3-5x OTE |
| AE (SMB) | 50:50 | $100-150K | New ARR = 4-6x OTE |
| AE (Mid-Market) | 50:50 | $150-250K | New ARR = 4-5x OTE |
| AE (Enterprise) | 60:40 | $200-350K | New ARR = 3-4x OTE |
| CS/AM | 70:30 | $80-150K | NRR + expansion targets |

**Comp Design Rules:**
1. Variable comp should be simple — max 3 components
2. Accelerators kick in at 100% attainment (1.5-2x rate)
3. Decelerators below 50% attainment (0.5x rate)
4. SPIFs should be <10% of total comp — use sparingly
5. Clawback only on churns within 90 days
6. Pay monthly, not quarterly (motivation)

### Territory Design

```yaml
# territory-design.yaml
method: "balanced"  # balanced | named-account | geographic | vertical

balancing_criteria:
  - factor: "Total addressable accounts"
    weight: 30
  - factor: "Historical revenue potential"
    weight: 30
  - factor: "Current pipeline value"
    weight: 20
  - factor: "Account density (effort to cover)"
    weight: 20

rules:
  - "No rep should have >2x the TAM of another rep"
  - "Named accounts assigned by relationship, not geography"
  - "New territories get 25% pipeline seed from marketing"
  - "Territory changes only at fiscal year (exceptions: termination, promotion)"
  - "Overlay reps (solutions engineers) shared across max 4 AEs"

review_cadence: "Quarterly assessment, annual reassignment"
```

## Phase 11: Forecasting & Planning

### Annual Revenue Planning Model

```yaml
# revenue-plan.yaml
fiscal_year: "2026"

targets:
  total_arr_target: 0
  new_business: 0  # typically 60-70% of net new
  expansion: 0     # typically 30-40% of net new
  
assumptions:
  gross_churn_rate: "0%"
  expansion_rate: "0%"
  avg_new_deal_size: 0
  avg_expansion_deal_size: 0
  new_win_rate: "0%"
  expansion_win_rate: "0%"  # typically 2-3x new business win rate
  avg_sales_cycle_new: "0 days"
  avg_sales_cycle_expansion: "0 days"
  
derived:
  new_deals_needed: 0  # new_business ÷ avg_deal_size
  opps_needed: 0       # new_deals_needed ÷ win_rate
  sqls_needed: 0       # opps_needed ÷ sql_to_opp_rate
  mqls_needed: 0       # sqls_needed ÷ mql_to_sql_rate
  pipeline_needed: 0   # opps_needed × avg_deal_size

capacity:
  aes_at_full_ramp: 0
  quota_per_ae: 0
  expected_attainment: "0%"
  productive_capacity: 0  # aes × quota × attainment
  gap: 0  # target - capacity
  hires_needed: 0
```

### Scenario Planning

Always model three scenarios:

| Scenario | Revenue | Key Assumptions | Actions |
|----------|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Bear** (70% confidence) | -20% from plan | Win rate drops 5pts, cycle +15 days, churn +2pts | Reduce hiring, focus on expansion, cut discretionary |
| **Base** (50% confidence) | Plan | Current trends continue | Execute plan |
| **Bull** (30% confidence) | +20% from plan | Win rate up 5pts, cycle -10 days, expansion up | Accelerate hiring, invest in new channels |

## Phase 12: RevOps Operating Rhythm

### Weekly RevOps Cadence

| Day | Meeting | Duration | Attendees | Focus |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Monday | Pipeline generation review | 30 min | SDR managers + Marketing | MQL quality, outbound metrics, campaign performance |
| Tuesday | Deal review | 45 min | AE managers | Top deals, stuck deals, forecast updates |
| Wednesday | Cross-functional sync | 30 min | RevOps + Marketing + Sales + CS leads | Funnel health, SLA compliance, blockers |
| Thursday | Forecast call | 30 min | CRO + managers | Commit/best case updates, risk deals |
| Friday | Data quality + process | 30 min | RevOps team | Hygiene reports, automation updates, tooling |

### Monthly Review Template

```markdown
## Monthly RevOps Review — [Month Year]

### Headline Metrics
| Metric | Actual | Target | Δ | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|---|-------|
| ARR | | | | ↑↓→ |
| Net New ARR | | | | |
| NRR | | | | |
| CAC Payback | | | | |
| Pipeline Coverage | | | | |
| Forecast Accuracy | | | | |

### Funnel Analysis
| Stage | Volume | Conversion | vs. Last Month | vs. Target |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|------------|

### What Worked
1. [...]

### What Didn't
1. [...]

### Process Changes Made
1. [...]

### Next Month Priorities
1. [...]
```

### Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Structure

1. **Results vs. Plan** (10 min) — ARR, NRR, efficiency metrics
2. **Funnel Deep Dive** (15 min) — Stage-by-stage with cohort trends
3. **Pipeline Quality** (10 min) — Coverage, aging, source mix
4. **GTM Efficiency** (10 min) — CAC, payback, magic number, by segment
5. **Team Performance** (10 min) — Rep productivity, ramp, attrition
6. **Process & Tech** (10 min) — What changed, what's planned
7. **Next Quarter Plan** (15 min) — Targets, capacity, key bets

## Phase 13: Advanced RevOps Patterns

### Revenue Intelligence

Build signals that predict outcomes before they happen:

| Signal | Predicts | Data Source | Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-threading (3+ contacts engaged) | 2.3x higher win rate | CRM + email | Coach reps on multi-threading |
| Champion job change | Churn risk OR new opp | LinkedIn alerts | CS: protect account, Sales: pursue new co |
| Decreasing product usage | Churn in 60-90 days | Product analytics | CS intervention + exec sponsor call |
| Pricing page + competitor page in same session | High-intent comparison shopper | Web analytics | Priority SDR outreach |
| CFO/finance contact added to deal | Deal in budget approval | CRM | Adjust timeline, prepare ROI doc |

### Cohort Analysis Framework

Track every cohort of customers by:
- **Acquisition month** — Do newer cohorts retain better?
- **ACV band** — Do bigger deals churn less?
- **Sales cycle length** — Do faster deals have higher NRR?
- **Lead source** — Which channels produce best LTV?
- **Industry** — Which verticals are stickiest?

### PLG + Sales Hybrid Model

```yaml
# plg-sales-handoff.yaml
self_serve_signals:
  - signal: "Workspace has 5+ active users"
    action: "Auto-assign to AE for outreach"
  - signal: "Hitting usage limits"
    action: "In-app upgrade prompt + AE notification"
  - signal: "Admin invited 10+ users"
    action: "Schedule product-led onboarding call"
  - signal: "Enterprise domain detected (Fortune 500)"
    action: "Immediate AE assignment regardless of usage"

pql_definition:  # Product Qualified Lead
  must_have:
    - "Completed onboarding (core activation milestone)"
    - "3+ active users in last 7 days"
    - "Used 2+ core features"
  nice_to_have:
    - "Connected integration"
    - "Shared workspace externally"
    - "Hit usage warning (>80% of limit)"
```

## Phase 14: Common RevOps Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Too many metrics — can't focus | Max 5 metrics per team, aligned to one goal |
| 2 | MQL definition too loose | Tighten with firmographic + behavioral (score >50) |
| 3 | No SLAs between teams | Implement Phase 7 SLAs, review monthly |
| 4 | CRM is a data graveyard | Required fields, validation rules, weekly hygiene |
| 5 | Forecast = wishful thinking | MEDDPICC-based categories, track accuracy |
| 6 | Over-automating before process exists | Manual first, then automate what works |
| 7 | Comp plan rewards wrong behavior | Align to NRR, not just new logo |
| 8 | No closed-lost analysis | Mandatory field, monthly review, product feedback loop |
| 9 | RevOps reports to Sales only | Report to CRO/CEO — neutral across functions |
| 10 | Building dashboards nobody uses | Start with questions, not charts |

---

## 100-Point RevOps Quality Rubric

| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Data Integrity** | 20 | Single source of truth, <2% duplicates, required fields enforced, hygiene automated |
| **Funnel Definitions** | 15 | All stages defined, agreed cross-functionally, conversion tracked weekly |
| **Pipeline Management** | 15 | Coverage tracked, velocity measured, forecast accuracy <15% MAPE |
| **Cross-Team Alignment** | 15 | SLAs exist, reviewed monthly, handoffs documented, shared metrics |
| **Automation** | 10 | Lead routing <5 min, renewal alerts automated, key workflows built |
| **Analytics** | 10 | Dashboard updated weekly, cohort analysis running, leading indicators tracked |
| **Compensation** | 8 | Plans documented, aligned to strategy, accelerators at 100%, simple (≤3 components) |
| **Process Documentation** | 7 | Playbooks exist, onboarding covers them, quarterly review cycle |

**Scoring:** 0-2 per sub-criterion within each dimension.
- 80-100: World-class RevOps
- 60-79: Strong foundation
- 40-59: Gaps are costing revenue
- <40: RevOps is a title, not a function

## Edge Cases

### Startup (Pre-$1M ARR)
- Skip territory design and comp complexity
- Focus on: funnel definitions, CRM hygiene, basic pipeline tracking
- One person can be "RevOps" part-time (often founder or first ops hire)

### PLG-Dominant
- Replace MQL with PQL (product qualified lead)
- Lead scoring = product usage signals, not content engagement
- Self-serve metrics: activation rate, time-to-value, conversion from free

### Usage-Based Pricing
- Pipeline = estimated annual usage, not fixed contract
- Forecasting is harder — use trailing usage trends + growth rate
- Expansion is organic — track net dollar expansion separately

### Multi-Product
- Attribution gets complex — track by product line
- Cross-sell pipeline tracked separately from new business
- Beware double-counting ARR across products

### International
- Territory design must account for language, timezone, currency
- Separate pipeline and conversion benchmarks by region
- Local compliance (GDPR, data residency) affects tech stack

### Post-M&A Integration
- Audit both CRM systems — pick one, migrate fast
- Reconcile definitions (their "SQL" ≠ your "SQL")
- Expect 3-6 month data quality dip — plan for it
