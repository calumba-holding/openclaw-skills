# CatchClaw Agentar Manager

**Source:** This skill is from the [CatchClaw skill repository](https://github.com/OpenAgentar/catchclaw).

An agentar is a distributable agent archive (ZIP) containing workspace files such as SOUL.md, skills, and other configuration. It can be installed as a new agent or used to overwrite an existing agent with a single command.

## Trigger Conditions

- User asks to search / find / browse agentars
- User asks to install / download a specific agentar
- User asks to export / package an agent as an agentar
- User asks to rollback / undo / restore a previous agent workspace
- User mentions the keyword "agentar" or "catchclaw"

**Important:** Before performing any action, ensure the agentar CLI is available at `~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs` (see CLI Setup). Do not run search, install, export, or rollback until the CLI is present.

## CLI Setup (mandatory — run before any command)

<HARD-GATE>
**Before running any search, install, export, or rollback command, you MUST ensure `~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs` exists.** No download is required. On every use of this skill:

1. **Check:** See if `~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs` exists (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.agentar\agentar_cli.mjs`).
2. **If it does not exist:** Copy `agentar_cli.mjs` from the skill directory (the same directory as this SKILL.md, or the skill's installation path such as `~/.agents/skills/catchclaw/`) to `~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs`. Create the directory `~/.agentar` if it does not exist. If `metadata.json` is present in the skill directory, copy it to `~/.agentar/metadata.json` as well.
3. **Verify:** Run `node ~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs version`. Only after it succeeds, proceed with search/install/export/rollback.

Never run `$CLI search`, `$CLI install`, `$CLI export`, or `$CLI rollback` until the CLI is present and verification passes.
</HARD-GATE>

## CLI Location

Before running any command, locate the CLI using this priority:

1. **Primary:** `node ~/.agentar/agentar_cli.mjs`
2. **Fallback:** `agentar` (if available in PATH)

On Windows, `~` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%`.

All commands below use `$CLI` as shorthand for the resolved CLI invocation.

## Commands

### Search

```bash
$CLI search <keyword>
```

Search the CatchClaw marketplace for agentars matching the keyword.

### Install

```bash
$CLI install <slug> --overwrite
$CLI install <slug> --name <name> [--api-key <key>]
```

Install an agentar from the marketplace.

**Options:**
- `--overwrite` — Overwrite the main agent (`~/.openclaw/workspace`). Existing workspace is backed up automatically.
- `--name <name>` — Create a new agent with the given name. Existing agents are not affected.
- `--api-key <key>` — (Optional) API key to save into `skills/.credentials` for agentars that require backend authentication.

### Export

```bash
$CLI export [--agent <id>] [-o <path>] [--include-memory]
```

Export an agent as a distributable agentar ZIP package. MEMORY.md is excluded by default. Output defaults to `~/agentar-exports/`. Sensitive files (`.credentials`, `.env`, `.secret`, `.key`, `.pem`) are automatically filtered out.

**Options:**
- `--agent <id>` — Agent ID to export. **If the user did not specify an agent, you MUST list agents and ask the user to choose before running export; do not export without the user's selection.**
- `-o, --output <path>` — Output ZIP file path.
- `--include-memory` — Include MEMORY.md in export (excluded by default).

### Rollback

```bash
$CLI rollback
$CLI rollback --latest
```

Restore a workspace from backup. Without `--latest`, lists all available backups for selection. The current workspace is automatically backed up before restoring, so rollback is always safe.

### Version

```bash
$CLI version
```

Show the CLI version.

## Installation Rules

<HARD-GATE>
Before executing `install`:
1. **Slug required:** If the user wants to install an agentar but has not specified which one (no slug), prompt the user to enter the agentar name/slug to install. Do NOT run install without a slug.
2. **Mode confirmation:** You MUST confirm the installation mode with the user. Do NOT run the install command without the user's explicit choice.

Present the following two options:
1. **overwrite** — Overwrite the main agent (~/.openclaw/workspace). The existing workspace will be backed up automatically.
2. **new** — Create a new agent. The existing agents are not affected.

After the user selects overwrite, execute: `$CLI install <slug> --overwrite`
After the user selects new, execute: `$CLI install <slug> --name <user-specified name>`

If the user does not specify a name for the new agent, use the slug as the default name.

Never execute install without a slug and without the user's explicit mode selection.
</HARD-GATE>

## Export Rules

<HARD-GATE>
**When the user has not specified which agent to export, you MUST let the user choose first. Do NOT export on your own.** If `--agent <id>` was not provided by the user:
1. Run `$CLI export` without `--agent` to list available agents (or equivalent to show choices).
2. Present the list to the user and ask which agent to export.
3. Only after the user explicitly selects an agent, run `$CLI export --agent <user-selected-id>` (and optional `-o`, `--include-memory` as needed). Never assume or pick an agent for the user.
</HARD-GATE>

- MEMORY.md is excluded by default. Only include it if the user explicitly requests it with `--include-memory`.
- Sensitive files are automatically filtered out during export (`.credentials`, `.env`, `.secret`, `.key`, `.pem`).
- After a successful export, remind the user to review the exported ZIP for any sensitive data (API keys, credentials, personal information).
- Export is a purely local operation — it does not require network access.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| CLI file not found at any path | Instruct user to install the CLI (see CLI Location section for options) |
| API unreachable or network error | Suggest checking network connectivity, or override the API URL with: `export AGENTAR_API_BASE_URL=<url>` |
| Node.js not installed | Instruct user to install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ |
| Download or extraction failure | Show the error message and suggest retrying the command |

## Workflow

1. **Search**: Run `$CLI search <keyword>` to find agentars. Each result includes a slug identifier.
2. **Install**: If the user did not specify which agentar to install (no slug), ask the user to enter the agentar name/slug. Then confirm installation mode (overwrite vs new) with the user. Only after you have both slug and mode, execute the install command.
3. **Export**: If the user did not specify which agent to export, run `$CLI export` (no `--agent`) to list agents, present the list to the user, and ask them to choose. Only after the user selects an agent, run `$CLI export --agent <id>`. Do not export without the user's explicit selection.
4. **Rollback**: If the user wants to undo an overwrite install, run `$CLI rollback` to list available backups and restore one.
