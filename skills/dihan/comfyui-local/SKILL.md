# ComfyUI Local Skill

This skill allows OpenClaw to generate images by connecting to a ComfyUI instance running on the local network.

## Setup

1. **Server Address:** Set the `COMFYUI_SERVER_ADDRESS` environment variable to your PC's IP and port (e.g., `http://192.168.1.119:8189`).
2. **API Mode:** Ensure **"Enable Dev mode"** is turned on in your ComfyUI settings to allow API interactions.

## Usage

### Generate an Image
Run the internal generation script with a prompt:
```bash
python3 {skillDir}/scripts/comfy_gen.py "your image prompt" $COMFYUI_SERVER_ADDRESS
```

### Use a Custom Workflow
Place your API JSON workflows in the `workflows/` folder, then specify the path:
```bash
python3 {skillDir}/scripts/comfy_gen.py "your prompt" $COMFYUI_SERVER_ADDRESS --workflow {skillDir}/workflows/my_workflow.json
```

## Features
- **SDXL Default:** Uses a high-quality SDXL workflow (Juggernaut XL) by default.
- **Auto-Backup:** Designed to save images to `image-gens/` and can be configured to sync to local document folders.
- **Custom Workflows:** Supports external API JSON workflows saved in the `workflows/` folder. The script will automatically try to inject your prompt and a random seed into the workflow nodes.

## Implementation Details
The skill uses a Python helper (`scripts/comfy_gen.py`) to handle the WebSocket/HTTP handshake with the ComfyUI API, queue the prompt, and download the resulting image.
