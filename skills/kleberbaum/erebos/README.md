# Erebos

**Darkness, accessible.**

## Vision

Erebos delivers dark themes that are comfortable to the eye and compliant with accessibility standards. No more blinding whites—just balanced contrast and smooth transitions.

## Get Started

1. Install the skill via ClawHub.
2. Run `theme-gen.sh --palette <color>` to generate a palette.
3. Use `--preview` to see the result before applying.

## Theming API

Erebos exposes theme tokens as CSS custom properties. Import the generated file or integrate via your build pipeline. Runtime switching is supported via `data-theme` attributes.
