# sovereign-docker-wizard

Docker optimization expert. Analyzes Dockerfiles for security and performance, generates multi-stage builds, optimizes image size, creates docker-compose configs, and identifies container misconfigurations.

## What It Does

When you install this skill, your AI agent becomes a Docker specialist that can:

1. **Analyze Dockerfiles** -- Score across 5 dimensions (size, build performance, security, reliability, maintainability) with specific findings and fixes
2. **Generate Multi-Stage Builds** -- Battle-tested patterns for Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, and Java
3. **Optimize Image Size** -- Layer ordering, .dockerignore generation, alpine vs distroless selection, apt-get cleanup
4. **Security Audit Containers** -- Detect root users, secrets in layers, unsigned images, unnecessary privileges, socket mounts, host filesystem access
5. **Generate docker-compose** -- Development and production configurations with health checks, resource limits, secrets management, and networking
6. **CI/CD Integration** -- GitHub Actions and GitLab CI pipeline configs with build caching and vulnerability scanning

## Capabilities

| Area | What It Covers |
|------|---------------|
| **Dockerfile Analysis** | Scoring rubric (0-100), layer-by-layer inspection, anti-pattern detection |
| **Multi-Stage Builds** | Node.js/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java/Spring Boot patterns |
| **Size Optimization** | Base image selection, layer ordering, .dockerignore, cache mounts, cleanup |
| **Security** | Root detection, secrets in ENV/COPY, unpinned images, privileged mode, socket mounts |
| **Compose Generation** | Dev vs prod configs, health checks, secrets, networking, resource limits |
| **Health Checks** | HTTP patterns, endpoint design, parameter tuning |
| **Resource Limits** | Memory, CPU, PID limits, ulimits |
| **Networking** | Custom networks, internal networks, DNS, port binding |
| **Volumes** | Named volumes, bind mounts, tmpfs, backup patterns |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, BuildKit cache mounts |
| **Anti-Patterns** | 8 common mistakes with exact before/after fixes |

## Install

```bash
clawhub install sovereign-docker-wizard
```

## Usage

After installation, ask your agent to work with Docker:

```
Analyze this Dockerfile and tell me how to optimize it.
```

```
Generate a docker-compose for a React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis stack.
```

```
Security audit this docker-compose configuration.
```

```
Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for my Go microservice.
```

```
What's wrong with this Dockerfile? It builds to 2GB.
```

The agent will produce structured analysis with scores, findings ordered by severity, and complete before/after code examples.
