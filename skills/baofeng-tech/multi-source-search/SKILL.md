# Multi-Source Search Verification Engine

Compare multiple search surfaces in one pass and score how confident the result set looks before you synthesize it.

## When to use

- The user wants the same topic checked across multiple search surfaces instead of one provider.
- The user needs confidence scoring, cross-source verification, or a consensus-style research output.
- The user wants a growth-variant search lane focused on validation, not just lookup.

## When NOT to use

- The user only needs one flagship search entry for lookup, cited answers, or deep research; use `search`.
- The task is provider-specific and fits `scholar-search`, `tavily-search`, or `perplexity-search`.
- The workflow must avoid relay-based calls to `api.aisa.one`.

## Capabilities

- Parallel retrieval across structured web, scholar, smart search, Tavily, and Perplexity-backed flows.
- Confidence scoring that highlights source coverage, diversity, and result quality.
- Synthesis-ready outputs for research comparison, verification, and decision support.

One API key gives you:
- Structured web search
- Scholar search
- Hybrid scholar search
- Tavily search and extraction tools
- Perplexity Sonar answer-generation endpoints with citations

## Compatibility

Works with any [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)-compatible
harness, including:

- **Claude Code** and **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **OpenAI Codex**
- **Cursor**
- **Gemini CLI** (Google)
- **OpenCode**, **Goose**, **OpenClaw**, **Hermes**
- and any other harness that implements the [Agent Skills
  specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)

Requires Python 3, a POSIX shell, and `AISA_API_KEY` (get one at
[aisa.one](https://aisa.one)).

## What This Skill Is Best For

### Fast web lookup
```text
Search the latest AI infrastructure launches and summarize the top sources.
```

### Scholar-backed research
```text
Find recent papers on multimodal reasoning from 2024 onward.
```

### Citation-rich answers
```text
Use Sonar Pro to answer which open-source agent frameworks are gaining traction and cite sources.
```

### Deep research reports
```text
Use Sonar Deep Research to produce a thorough market map of AI browser agents.
```

## Quick Start

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Example Requests

- Compare how three search surfaces describe the latest browser-use agent products.
- Verify whether a market claim shows up in web search, scholar search, and cited answer results.
- Run a confidence-scored research pass on multi-agent IDEs before writing a recommendation.

## Search APIs

### Web Search

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/scholar/search/web?query=AI+frameworks&max_num_results=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

### Scholar Search

```bash

## Perplexity Sonar APIs

The deprecated `/search/full` and `/search/smart` nodes have been removed from this skill.

The replacement flow is the Perplexity API family:

| Endpoint | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `/perplexity/sonar` | Lightweight, cost-effective search answers with citations |
| `/perplexity/sonar-pro` | Better for complex queries and multi-step follow-ups |
| `/perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` | Stronger analytical reasoning with web search |
| `/perplexity/sonar-deep-research` | Exhaustive research and long-form reports |

These descriptions are based on the AIsa docs:
- [Sonar](https://aisa.one/docs/api-reference/perplexity/post_perplexity-sonar)
- [Sonar Pro](https://aisa.one/docs/api-reference/perplexity/post_perplexity-sonar-pro)
- [Sonar Reasoning Pro](https://aisa.one/docs/api-reference/perplexity/post_perplexity-sonar-reasoning-pro)

|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/scholar/search/web` | POST | Web search with structured results |
| `/scholar/search/scholar` | POST | Academic paper search |
| `/scholar/search/smart` | POST | Hybrid scholar search |
| `/scholar/explain` | POST | Generate result explanations |
| `/perplexity/sonar` | POST | Lightweight search answers with citations |

## Parameters

### Scholar search query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Search query |
| `max_num_results` | integer | Max results (default 10) |
| `as_ylo` | integer | Year lower bound |
| `as_yhi` | integer | Year upper bound |

### Perplexity request body

This skill sends a minimal OpenAI-style payload:

```json
{
  "model": "sonar-pro",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Optional system instruction"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Your question"}
  ]
}
```

Use `messages` because the AIsa Perplexity endpoints are presented as "Ask AI" endpoints in the official docs. This skill keeps the payload intentionally small for broad compatibility.

## Notes

- `/search/full` and `/search/smart` are no longer documented here because you indicated those nodes have been retired.
- The existing scholar and Tavily endpoints remain available.
- `verity` still focuses on parallel retrieval from scholar, web, hybrid scholar, and Tavily sources.
