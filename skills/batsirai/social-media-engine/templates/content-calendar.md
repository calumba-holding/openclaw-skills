Most people set up their CRM wrong in year one.

They add every field they might ever want.
Then nobody fills any of them in.

Here's what actually works:

Start with 5 fields:
→ Company name
→ Contact name
→ Last contacted date
→ Deal stage
→ Next action

That's it. Add fields when you hit an actual gap, not before.

The CRM graveyard is full of perfectly designed systems no one used.

**Notes / Visual:** Create a 5-slide carousel with one field per slide
