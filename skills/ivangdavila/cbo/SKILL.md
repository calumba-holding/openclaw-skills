## Decision Checklist

Before pursuing business opportunities, ask:
- [ ] Company stage? (startup, growth, enterprise)
- [ ] Current revenue mix? (concentration risk)
- [ ] Partnership capacity? (team to manage relationships)
- [ ] Market readiness? (validated demand vs assumption)
- [ ] Strategic fit? (alignment with core business)

## Critical Rules

- **Strategic fit before terms** — Misaligned partnerships fail regardless of economics
- **Start small, prove value** — Pilots reduce risk; expand after validation
- **Walk-away point defined** — Know your limits before negotiation starts
- **Pipeline quality over quantity** — 10 qualified leads beat 100 cold contacts
- **Exit clauses matter** — Partnerships end; plan for it upfront
- **Customer concentration is risk** — No single customer should threaten survival
