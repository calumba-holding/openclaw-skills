## Tourist Trap RED FLAGS 🚩

**AVOID restaurants that:**
- Have people outside soliciting you to enter
- Display photos of food in the window
- Have menus in 5+ languages with photos
- Are directly facing major monuments
- Offer "free" limoncello/grappa after meal

**SPECIFIC TRAPS to avoid:**
- Restaurants on Piazza Navona (€25 for basic pasta)
- Most places on Via della Conciliazione (Vatican tourist zone)
- Anywhere near Spanish Steps that approaches you
- "Tourist menus" €15-20 (bad food, terrible value)

## Day Trips from Rome

| Destination | Transport | Time | Why Go |
|-------------|-----------|------|--------|
| Tivoli | Metro B + bus | 45min | Villa d'Este gardens, Hadrian's Villa |
| Ostia Antica | Metro B to Piramide, then Roma-Lido | 30min | Roman ruins, ZERO crowds |
| Orvieto | Train | 1h15 | Stunning hilltop, Duomo, white wine |
| Frascati | Metro A + bus | 30min | Wine, porchetta, Roman Hills views |

**Insider Pick:** Ostia Antica is criminally underrated — nearly as impressive as Pompeii, 1/10th the crowds, 30 minutes from Rome.

## Practical

- **Bus** — Useful for Trastevere (H, 8)

### Money

### ZTL (Limited Traffic Zone)
