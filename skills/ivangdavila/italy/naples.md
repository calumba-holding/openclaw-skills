## Safety — Real Talk

**Naples is safer than its reputation.** But:

| Risk | Reality | Advice |
|------|---------|--------|
| Pickpockets | Common on metro, tourist areas | Front pocket, no flashy jewelry |
| Scooter theft | Rare for tourists | Watch bags on sidewalks near street |
| Scams | Menu prices differ, fake guides | Ask price BEFORE, only licensed guides |
| Driving | Insane, ignore at your peril | Don't drive here |

**At Night:**
- Stick to main streets in Centro Storico
- Chiaia and seafront are very safe
- Quartieri Spagnoli deeper alleys — avoid after 23:00
- Piazza Garibaldi (train station area) — pass through quickly

**General Rules:**
- Don't wear expensive watches
- Keep phones in front pockets
- Cross streets WITH Italians (traffic won't stop)
- If someone approaches aggressively, walk to nearest shop

## Pompeii & Herculaneum — Local's Guide

### Pompeii
| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| From Naples | Circumvesuviana train from Garibaldi, €3.60, 35min to "Pompei Scavi" |
| Tickets | €18 online, €16 regular | Buy online to skip queue |
| Time Needed | 3-4 hours minimum |
| Best Time | 08:30 opening (summer), arrive early to beat heat |
| What to Skip | The forum (too crowded) until afternoon |
| Must-See | House of the Faun, Garden of the Fugitives, Villa dei Misteri |

**Local Secret:** Most tour groups hit the Forum first. Go LEFT at entrance, see houses and Villa dei Misteri first, then circle back to Forum at 11:00+ when groups move on.

### Herculaneum (Ercolano)
| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| From Naples | Circumvesuviana to "Ercolano Scavi", €2.80, 20min |
| Tickets | €13 regular, €22 combined with Pompeii (valid 3 days) |
| Time Needed | 2-3 hours |
| Why Visit | Smaller, better preserved, far fewer tourists |

**Insider Tip:** Herculaneum shows wealthy homes with intact wooden furniture, mosaic floors still vivid. If doing only ONE, consider Herculaneum over Pompeii — 80% less crowded.

## Day Trips
