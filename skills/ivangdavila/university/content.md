# Content Generation & Processing

## Processing Uploaded Materials

### PDFs (Textbooks, Papers, Slides)
1. **Extract structure** — Table of contents, chapters, sections
2. **Generate summary** — Key concepts per section (1 page per 50 pages)
3. **Identify definitions** — Extract and format as glossary
4. **Create flashcards** — Automatic Q&A from key concepts
5. **Map to curriculum** — Link to relevant module

### Audio (Lectures, Podcasts)
1. **Transcribe** — Full text with timestamps
2. **Extract key points** — Summarize main ideas
3. **Generate notes** — Structured like lecture notes
4. **Create searchable index** — Find topics by keyword
5. **Produce condensed version** — 4-hour lecture → 30-min summary audio

### Video (Classes, Tutorials)
1. **Extract frames** — Key moments, diagrams, formulas
2. **Transcribe speech** — With timestamps
3. **Generate chapter markers** — Navigate to specific topics
4. **Summarize** — What was taught in each section
5. **Create practice questions** — Based on content

### Handwritten Notes / Whiteboard Photos
1. **OCR** — Extract text
2. **Interpret diagrams** — Describe visual content
3. **Clean up** — Format into readable notes
4. **Merge with other sources** — Unify with typed notes

## Generating Study Materials

### Summaries
- **Levels:** Executive (1 paragraph), Standard (1 page), Detailed (full notes)
- **Focus on:** What will be tested, not trivia
- **Include:** Definitions, formulas, key relationships
- **Exclude:** Filler, redundant examples, tangents

### Explanations
- **Adapt to level:** Beginner vs advanced explanations
- **Use analogies:** Connect to what user already knows
- **Multiple approaches:** If one explanation fails, try another
- **Verify understanding:** Ask user to explain back

### Mind Maps
- **Central concept** with radiating topics
- **Show relationships** between ideas
- **Color-code** by module/priority
- **Exportable** as image or interactive

### Cheatsheets
- **One page maximum**
- **Formulas, key facts, quick references**
- **Organized by topic**
- **Printable format**

## Generating Audio Content

### Study Podcasts
- Convert any material to conversational audio
- Useful for: commutes, exercise, passive review
- Include: summaries, explanations, self-test prompts
- Avoid: complex visuals that require seeing

### Dictated Notes
- Read summaries aloud for auditory learners
- Slower pace with repetition of key terms
- Pause points for user reflection

## Curating External Resources

### Course Selection
- Filter by: recency, reviews, completion rate, practical focus
- Prefer: one excellent course over 10 mediocre ones
- Check: is content up to date?
- Avoid: outdated, too theoretical, bad production quality

### Book Recommendations
- Match to user's level (intro vs advanced)
- Check: recent editions for fast-changing fields
- Provide: reading guides (which chapters matter most)
- Estimate: reading time per chapter

### Paper/Article Selection
- Academic sources for depth
- Summarize before full read (is it worth the time?)
- Extract: findings, methodology, implications
- Cite properly: format for user's needs (APA, IEEE, etc.)

## Content for Specific Fields

### STEM
- Focus on: problem-solving, derivations, proofs
- Generate: practice problems with worked solutions
- Include: code examples for CS, lab procedures for sciences

### Law/Medicine
- Focus on: case studies, clinical scenarios, legal precedents
- Generate: situational questions, oral exam prep
- Update: when laws/guidelines change

### Humanities
- Focus on: analysis, argumentation, context
- Generate: essay outlines, discussion questions
- Include: primary source excerpts with commentary

### Business
- Focus on: frameworks, case analysis, quantitative methods
- Generate: case study analyses, Excel models
- Include: real company examples
