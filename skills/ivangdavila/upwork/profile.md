# Profile Optimization

## Title Formula

`[Primary Skill] | [Secondary Skill] | [Differentiator]`

Examples:
- "React Developer | Next.js Expert | 50+ E-commerce Projects"
- "Copywriter | Email Sequences | B2B SaaS Focus"

## Bio Structure (First 2 Lines Critical)

Line 1: What you do + who you help + result you deliver
Line 2: Proof (years, projects, notable clients)
Rest: Skills, process, call to action

## Portfolio Curation

- 6-8 pieces maximum (quality over quantity)
- Lead with best work
- Include outcome/results, not just deliverable
- Match portfolio to jobs you want

## Hourly Rate Strategy

| Experience | Starting Rate | Goal |
|------------|---------------|------|
| New (<$1k earned) | Lower range for niche, build reviews fast |
| Rising ($1k-10k) | Market rate, selective with projects |
| Established (>$10k) | Premium rate, direct invitations |

## What Tanks Profiles

- Generic title ("Freelancer", "Virtual Assistant")
- Bio focused on you, not client outcomes
- No portfolio items or irrelevant samples
- Inconsistent availability status
