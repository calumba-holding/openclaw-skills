## Job Success Score (JSS)

Factors:
- Client feedback (public + private)
- Long-term client relationships
- Contract outcomes (completed vs cancelled)
- Responsiveness

**To protect JSS:**
- Close inactive contracts (stale contracts hurt)
- Never abandon without communication
- Ask for private feedback before public review
- Resolve issues before they become disputes

## Contract Types

| Type | When to Use | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| Fixed-price | Clear scope, defined deliverables | Scope creep |
| Hourly | Ongoing work, unclear scope | Time tracking scrutiny |
| Milestone-based | Large fixed projects | Protect with partial payments |

**Fixed-price protection:** Never start without funded milestone
**Hourly protection:** Screenshot tracking, detailed memos
