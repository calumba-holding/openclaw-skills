# Proposal Writing

## Structure That Converts

1. **Hook** — Reference something SPECIFIC from the job post (proves you read it)
2. **Credibility** — 1-2 relevant portfolio examples, not your whole history
3. **Approach** — Brief outline of how you'd tackle THIS project
4. **CTA** — Concrete next step: "15-min call to clarify scope?"

## What Kills Proposals

- "Dear Hiring Manager" or generic openers
- Copy-pasted templates without customization
- Listing all skills instead of relevant ones
- Asking questions answered in the job post
- Pricing without understanding scope

## Pricing Strategy

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Competitive job (50+ proposals) | Slightly below rate to enter, upsell later |
| Direct invitation | Premium rate — they chose YOU |
| Complex scope | "Happy to discuss after quick call" |
| Unclear budget | Propose range, ask clarifying questions |

## Connects Efficiency

- Best Match jobs in first 2 hours = highest conversion
- Direct invitations = don't need connects, respond FAST
- Skip jobs with 50+ proposals unless perfect match
- Never boost without strong profile/history
