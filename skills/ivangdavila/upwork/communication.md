# Client Communication

## Response Timing

- First reply <2 hours (algorithm rewards speed)
- Business hours consistency (set expectations)
- Weekend silence is OK if communicated

## Message Templates (Adapt, Don't Copy)

**Scope creep:**
> "Happy to add [feature]. Since it's outside original scope, I can include it for $X additional. Want me to update the milestone?"

**Delays:**
> "Quick update: [specific reason] means delivery will be [date] instead of [original]. I'll keep you posted. Let me know if this affects anything on your end."

**Asking for review:**
> "Thanks for the great collaboration! If you have a moment, a review would help me a lot. No pressure either way."

## Negotiation Principles

- Never negotiate against yourself (let them counter)
- "My rate is X because [value justification]"
- Walk away from scope creep without pay adjustment
- Document EVERYTHING in Upwork chat (legal protection)

## Tone Matching

| Client Type | Communication Style |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Corporate | Formal, structured, status updates |
| Startup | Direct, casual, quick back-and-forth |
| Creative | Show personality, collaborative tone |
