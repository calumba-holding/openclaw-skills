- Clap between songs, not during
- No photos during songs
- Dress smart casual

| Santa Catarina | Sunset, young crowd | Medium |

## Beaches Near Lisbon

- **Costa da Caparica** — Long beach strip, surf, young crowd. Bus from Praça Espanha.
- **Cascais** — Town beach, easy train access, gets crowded
- **Guincho** — Wild, windy, surfing. Need car.
- **Arrábida** — Crystal clear, protected, stunning. Need car, go early.

**Water temperature:** 17-20°C even in summer. Atlantic is cold.

## Lisbon Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Tram 28** — Pickpocket heaven. Walk Alfama instead, it's more charming.
2. **Eating at Praça do Comércio** — 2x prices, mediocre food
3. **Pastéis de Belém queue** — Same recipe at Manteigaria, no wait
4. **Driving in center** — Impossible parking. Walk/metro/Uber.
5. **Expecting warm ocean** — It's the Atlantic. Bring a wetsuit or stick to pools.
6. **Wearing heels** — Cobblestones + hills = disaster
