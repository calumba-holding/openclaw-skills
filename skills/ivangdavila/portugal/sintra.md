# Sintra — Palaces, Gardens & Magic

## What is Sintra

A UNESCO town 30 km from Lisbon, where Portuguese royalty built fantasy palaces in misty hills. Think: colorful castles, romantic gardens, mysterious caves. Instagram heaven, but also genuinely magical.

**Warning:** Sintra is CROWDED. Go early, book online, or suffer.

## Getting There

### From Lisbon
- **Train** from Rossio station (center) — 40 min, €2.25 each way
- **First train:** 06:30. Take it if you're serious about avoiding crowds.
- **Last train back:** Around 00:30

### Once There
- **434 bus** — Circular: Station → Palácio Nacional → Castelo dos Mouros → Pena. €7 hop-on/hop-off
- **Walking** — Possible but brutal hills. Palace to palace = 30-45 min uphill
- **Tuk-tuk** — €15-20 per ride, unnecessary
- **Uber** — Difficult, few drivers

## The Palaces — Which to Visit

### Palácio da Pena ⭐ (Must-See)

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours (palace + park)
**Price:** €14 palace + park, €7.50 park only
**Book:** Online at parquesdesintra.pt — MANDATORY in summer

**Pro tips:**
- Enter through the park, walk up (30 min), see palace, then exit via main gate
- Go before 10:00 or after 15:00 to avoid tour groups
- The park itself is stunning — giant ferns, hidden paths, lakes
- Bring layers — it's usually 5°C cooler than Lisbon

### Quinta da Regaleira ⭐ (Must-See)
**What:** Gothic estate with initiatic wells, caves, tunnels, gardens
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours (easy to get lost)
**Price:** €10
**Book:** Online recommended

**The magic:**
- Poço Iniciático — Spiral well descending 27 meters, connects to tunnels
- Grotto system — Underground passages connecting the estate
- Chapel — Tiny, decorated in alchemical symbols
- Don't miss the tunnels from the lake to the tower

**Pro tip:** Download offline map — it's a maze and phone signal is weak.

### Castelo dos Mouros
**What:** 8th-century Moorish castle ruins with stunning views
**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours
**Price:** €8
**Why:** Best views of Pena Palace and coast. Less crowded than Pena.

**Distance:** 3.5 km from center (need transport)

### What to Wear
- **Comfortable shoes** — Cobblestones, hills, uneven paths
- **Layers** — Microclimate, always cooler than Lisbon
- **Rain jacket** — Morning mist common even in summer

### Money Savers
- **Parques de Sintra combo tickets** — Save 10-15% on multiple palaces
- **Book online** — Skip ticket queues (30-60 min in summer)

## Sintra Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Going on a weekend in summer** — Hell. Queues everywhere.
2. **Not booking online** — Ticket lines at Pena = 1 hour
3. **Taking the 434 bus at 10:00** — Packed. Take early train, beat the buses.
4. **Only visiting Pena** — Regaleira is equally impressive, less crowded
5. **Eating at main square** — Tourist traps. Walk 2 minutes away.
6. **Wearing flip-flops** — You'll regret it. Cobblestones everywhere.
7. **Driving** — Parking is nightmare. Take the train.
8. **Rushing** — Allow full day. Each palace deserves time.

## Combine With

- **Cascais** — Beach town, 20 min from Sintra. Good afternoon add-on.
- **Cabo da Roca** — Westernmost point of Europe. Bus from Sintra.
- **Mafra** — Baroque palace, farther but impressive. Need car.
