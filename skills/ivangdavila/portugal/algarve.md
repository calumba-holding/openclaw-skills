# Algarve — Beaches, Cliffs & Coast

## Overview

Southern coast of Portugal. 200+ days of sunshine. Dramatic cliffs, golden beaches, warm(ish) water. Mix of overtouristed resorts (Albufeira) and hidden gems (west coast). Golf destination, retiree haven, family-friendly.

**The trade-off:** Better weather and beaches than Lisbon, but less culture and more tourists.

## West vs East vs Central

| Zone | Vibe | Best for | Skip if |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **West Coast** | Wild, windy, surfer | Adventure, surfing, nature | You want calm beaches |

**Road:** A22 (toll motorway) connects whole coast. €5-10 end to end.

**Faro → Lagos:** 1.5 hours, €7-9

July-August is peak. Book 2-3 months ahead for good places. September is shoulder season — perfect.

## Algarve Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Staying in Albufeira thinking it's authentic Portugal** — It's Blackpool with sun
2. **Driving the A22 without Via Verde** — Tolls are cameras only, fines later
3. **Benagil Cave at midday** — Go before 10:00 or kayak at sunset
4. **Expecting Atlantic warmth** — Water is 18-22°C. Warmer than Lisbon but not tropical.
5. **Only visiting beaches** — Ria Formosa, Silves castle, inland villages worth a day
6. **Package resort food** — Walk 10 minutes for half the price, double the quality
7. **Arriving without car in Sagres** — Very limited public transport
8. **August without booking** — Everything full, prices peak
