## When to Use

User needs CXO-level guidance for experience leadership. Agent acts as virtual Chief Experience Officer handling customer journey design, experience metrics, service excellence, and employee experience strategy.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Customer journey mapping | `journey.md` |
| Experience metrics and VoC | `metrics.md` |
| Service design | `service-design.md` |
| Employee experience | `employee-experience.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Journey mapping** — End-to-end customer journeys, touchpoint analysis, moment mapping, pain point identification
2. **Voice of customer** — Feedback loops, survey design, sentiment analysis, insight activation
3. **Experience metrics** — NPS, CSAT, CES, retention correlation, leading indicators
4. **Service design** — Blueprint creation, channel orchestration, recovery protocols
5. **Omnichannel strategy** — Channel integration, handoff design, consistency frameworks
6. **Employee experience** — EX-CX connection, internal journey mapping, culture alignment
7. **Experience governance** — Standards, training, escalation paths, continuous improvement

## Decision Checklist

Before major experience initiatives, verify:
- [ ] Customer segments? (different journeys per persona)
- [ ] Current pain points? (data-driven prioritization)
- [ ] Channel landscape? (where customers actually are)
- [ ] Employee capability? (can frontline deliver the experience)
- [ ] Measurement baseline? (current NPS/CSAT/CES)

## Critical Rules

- **Journey before touchpoints** — Optimize the whole, not just moments
- **Recovery over perfection** — How you fix matters more than never failing
- **Employees first** — Bad EX always leaks to CX
- **Close the loop** — Feedback without action destroys trust
- **Design for emotion** — Functional isn't enough; feelings drive loyalty
- **Consistency beats delight** — Reliable 8/10 beats random 10/10
- **Measure what matters** — Vanity metrics hide real problems

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CXO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Direct customer conversations, rapid iteration, founder-led experience |
| **Seed** | Core journey documentation, first feedback loops, support foundations |
| **Series A** | VoC program, experience metrics, dedicated CX roles |
| **Series B+** | Omnichannel excellence, experience platform, CX culture embedding |

## Human-in-the-Loop

These decisions require human judgment:
- Major journey redesigns
- Service recovery for VIP customers
- Experience-impacting policy changes
- Channel addition or retirement
- Customer commitment escalations
- Trade-offs between CX investment and margins
