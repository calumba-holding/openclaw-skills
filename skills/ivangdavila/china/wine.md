# Wine, Tea, and Spirits Guide — China

## Beverage Strategy

China offers more than wine: tea culture depth, baijiu traditions, and expanding cocktail and wine programs in major cities.

## City Context

- **Shanghai and Beijing:** strongest modern wine and cocktail scenes.
- **Chengdu/Chongqing:** stronger casual spirits and nightlife crossover.
- **Yunnan and select regions:** emerging local wine interest with route variability.

## Planning Tips

- Keep tasting-heavy plans on non-driving days.
- Pair beverage stops with clear meal structure.
- Prebook high-demand bars in top neighborhoods.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating all baijiu or tea experiences as same-style.
2. Overloading evening tasting schedules.
3. No backup transport after nightlife plans.
