# Beaches and Coastal Stops — China

## Main Coastal Options

- **Hainan routes:** strongest tropical-beach logic.
- **Xiamen and Fujian edges:** city-plus-coast balance.
- **Shenzhen and nearby coast pockets:** short coast breaks from megacity bases.

## Planning Rules

- Check weather and sea conditions before committing day structure.
- Keep one urban backup option for rain and storm windows.
- Book peak-season transport and stays early.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning beach-only schedules with no weather fallback.
2. Underestimating holiday crowd spikes.
3. Long detours for short beach windows with low payoff.
