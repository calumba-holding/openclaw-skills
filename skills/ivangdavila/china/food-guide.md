## Dining Rules

- Plan one flagship meal and one flexible neighborhood meal per day.
- Reserve top demand venues early in tier-1 cities.
- Rotate heavy and light meals to sustain multi-day food routes.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Only eating in landmark strips.
2. Chasing queue length instead of quality indicators.
3. Overcommitting to heavy meals without pacing.
