**Best for:** First-time cultural orientation and major site access.

### Sanlitun and Chaoyang
**Vibe:** Modern dining, nightlife, expat mix, contemporary retail.
**Best for:** Evening plans and global-meets-local food routes.

### Gulou and hutong belts
**Vibe:** Human-scale lanes, cafes, local street rhythm.
**Best for:** Slower half-days away from large landmark traffic.
