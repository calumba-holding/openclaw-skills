# Payments and Internet Constraints — China

## Core Reality

Daily travel quality depends on payment readiness and app accessibility.

## Practical Setup

- Prepare at least two payment methods.
- Validate core transport and booking apps before arrival.
- Keep essential reservation data offline.

## Internet and App Strategy

- Expect differences in app performance by network context.
- Build offline workflows for maps, tickets, and addresses.
- Keep translation and contact details available without live connection.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Arriving with one payment method only.
2. No offline backup for bookings and navigation.
3. Assuming all global apps work identically in all contexts.
