# Chengdu and Chongqing Complete Guide

## Region Identity

Food-led megacities with different rhythm: Chengdu is slower and tea-house relaxed, Chongqing is vertical, intense, and transport-layered.

## Chengdu

- Great for Sichuan cuisine depth, pandas, and slower neighborhood pacing.
- Strong base for 3-4 days without constant transfers.

## Chongqing

- High-intensity urban terrain with dramatic night views.
- Better with planned district clustering due elevation and transit complexity.

## Food Strategy

- Build spice tolerance pacing across days.
- Prioritize focused hotpot and noodle routes by area.
- Keep lighter meal windows between heavy dinners.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating Chengdu and Chongqing as identical food-city experiences.
2. Overstacking spice-heavy meals without rest and hydration.
3. Ignoring vertical city-transfer complexity in Chongqing.
