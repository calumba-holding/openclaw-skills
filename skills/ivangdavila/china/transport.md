# Transport Guide — China

## In Cities

- Metro networks in major hubs are usually the fastest daily option.
- Ride-hailing is practical for late-night returns and station edges.
- District clustering saves time in mega-city layouts.

## Intercity

### High-speed rail
- Best for many major corridor routes.
- Book peak windows early and keep station transfer margins.

### Flights
- Useful for very long jumps and remote corridor access.
- Include airport travel overhead and delay buffers.

### Private car segments
- Best for selected nature routes and low-transit regions.
- Keep road-time realism and weather checks explicit.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Same-day long transfer plus dense sightseeing.
2. Tight connection windows with no margin.
3. Ignoring true end-to-end transfer cost.
