# Guangzhou and Shenzhen Complete Guide

## Region Pattern

This corridor is huge but efficient when planned by functional zones: old-culture districts, modern city cores, and tech-business hubs.

## Guangzhou

### Liwan and old city side
- Strong Cantonese heritage and food-market rhythm.

### Tianhe and Zhujiang New Town
- Modern skyline, shopping, and business-focused convenience.

## Shenzhen

### Futian and Nanshan
- Tech-centric urban fabric and modern dining.

### OCT and creative zones
- Better for relaxed culture and cafe routes.

## Strategy

- Pick one city as base unless trip length supports both.
- Use high-speed links intentionally, not as a constant shuttle habit.
- Focus on Cantonese food and dim sum planning in Guangzhou, and modern design/tech routes in Shenzhen.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overcommitting to daily cross-city commuting.
2. Ignoring district-level traffic patterns.
3. Treating the region as one uniform city experience.
