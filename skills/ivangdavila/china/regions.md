# Regions Overview — China

## Main Travel Regions

| Region | Trip Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| North (Beijing-Tianjin axis) | Imperial history, museums, cold-season city planning |
| East (Shanghai-Jiangnan) | Urban design, cuisine diversity, easy short intercity links |
| South (Guangdong and coast) | Cantonese food depth, megacity rhythm, humid climate |
| Southwest (Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou) | Food, mountain scenery, slower scenic routes |
| Northwest (Gansu-Qinghai corridors) | Distances, desert/highland landscapes, logistics-heavy |
| Islands and tropical south | Beach-focused pacing and weather-sensitive planning |

## Route Planning Rule

Choose one mega-hub plus one contrasting region for shorter trips.
For longer trips, use 2-3 bases max per 10-14 day block.
