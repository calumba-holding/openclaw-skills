# Silk Road West Corridor — Gansu and Qinghai

## Region Identity

Long distances, dramatic landscapes, and historical-route logic. This is where transfer planning and climate awareness matter most.

## Base Strategy

### Lanzhou and Xining connectors
- Strong route anchors for westbound movement.

### Dunhuang and corridor highlights
- Signature heritage and desert landscapes with high transport overhead.

## Route Rules

- Build explicit transfer and acclimatization buffers.
- Keep daytime fuel/food/water planning strict in remote segments.
- Use fewer stops with deeper coverage rather than checklist hopping.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Underestimating route distances and road-time fatigue.
2. Overcommitting to same-day long jumps plus sightseeing.
3. Ignoring weather and wind conditions in exposed areas.
