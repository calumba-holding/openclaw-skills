# Hiking Guide — China

## Core Rule

Pick hikes by altitude, weather, and current conditions, not only visuals.

## Strong Regions

- Southwest mountain corridors for scenery depth.
- Zhangjiajie/Hunan for structured viewpoint routes.
- Yunnan routes for mixed cultural and nature trails.

## Safety Basics

- Start early in heat-prone months.
- Carry water, layers, and offline maps.
- Respect closures and local guidance.
- Keep altitude adaptation in highland routes.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Starting too late on long routes.
2. Ignoring weather/visibility shifts.
3. Treating route-time estimates as universal.
