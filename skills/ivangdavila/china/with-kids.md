# China with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Shanghai | Transit ease and broad activity mix |
| Beijing | History, parks, and structured major attractions |
| Chengdu | Slower pace and food-family balance |
| Guangzhou/Shenzhen | Modern convenience with flexible day planning |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity plus downtime each day.
- Use weather and indoor backups in heat/rain periods.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overloading long transfer days.
2. Ignoring meal and rest windows.
3. Choosing accommodation far from daily routes.
