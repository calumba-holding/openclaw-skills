# Yunnan Complete Guide

## Route Pattern

Yunnan rewards slower multi-stop routing: Kunming as gateway, Dali/Lijiang for old-town and mountain access, Shangri-La for altitude and Tibetan-influenced context.

## Base Strategy

### Kunming
- Practical entry base and transport connector.

### Dali and Erhai zone
- Lake-town pace with cycling and old-town routes.

### Lijiang
- Tourism-heavy but still useful when paced well.

### Shangri-La
- High-altitude planning required.

## Yunnan Strategy

- Add altitude adaptation days when moving north/up.
- Avoid one-night chains; keep 2+ nights per base.
- Weather and mountain roads require buffer logic.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Doing Kunming-Dali-Lijiang-Shangri-La too fast.
2. Ignoring altitude and temperature swings.
3. Booking rigid plans in weather-sensitive windows.
