# Seasonality and Climate Strategy — China

## Core Reality

China has multiple climate systems. One national weather assumption can break itinerary quality.

## Regional Season Patterns

- **North:** colder winters, strong spring/autumn windows.
- **East coast:** humid summers, variable shoulder-season rain.
- **South and tropical zones:** heat, humidity, and storm-season sensitivity.
- **Southwest highland routes:** elevation-driven temperature shifts.
- **Northwest corridors:** dry conditions with strong day-night temperature swings.

## Planning Rule

Route by climate compatibility, not only map ambition.
Build one weather buffer day for every major scenic block.
