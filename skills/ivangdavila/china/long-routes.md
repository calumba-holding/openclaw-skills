# Long-Distance Route Patterns — China

## Rule Zero

China route success depends on transfer economics: distance, station/airport overhead, and recovery pacing.

## Proven Patterns

### North to East corridor
Beijing -> Shanghai with optional Nanjing/Hangzhou add-on.

### East to Southwest corridor
Shanghai -> Chengdu/Chongqing -> Yunnan branch.

### Culture + scenery spine
Beijing -> Xi'an -> Chengdu -> Guilin/Yangshuo.

## Buffer Logic

- Add one low-intensity block every 4-5 intense days.
- Treat long transfer days as partial days, not full itinerary days.
- Keep one contingency day in routes longer than 10 days.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Daily city swaps in long-haul segments.
2. No slack for disruption or fatigue.
3. Using only theoretical schedule times without real transfer overhead.
