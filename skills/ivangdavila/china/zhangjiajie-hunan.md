# Zhangjiajie and Hunan Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This area can be spectacular but logistically demanding. Queue management, cable-car timing, and weather visibility determine trip quality.

## Base Strategy

### Zhangjiajie city/Wulingyuan base
- Best for park access and early starts.

### Changsha add-on
- Better for city rhythm and food before/after park-heavy days.

## Route Rules

- Start early to reduce queue pressure.
- Keep one alternate low-visibility plan ready.
- Avoid stacking all major viewpoints in one day.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating park movement as flat urban walking pace.
2. Ignoring weather windows for key viewpoints.
3. Not budgeting queue and transfer times.
