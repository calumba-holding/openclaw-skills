# Entry and Documents Planning — China

## Core Principle

Entry and transit rules can change. Confirm latest requirements before booking non-refundable segments.

## Planning Checklist

- Passport validity and blank-page requirements
- Visa or visa-free eligibility for your nationality and route
- Accommodation booking records for first entry points
- Return/onward travel documentation
- Insurance and health documentation as needed

## Practical Rules

- Keep digital and offline copies of key documents.
- Align route design with actual entry conditions.
- Avoid last-minute changes that break document assumptions.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming old visa rules still apply.
2. Booking rigid internal routes before entry is confirmed.
3. Traveling without accessible backup copies.
