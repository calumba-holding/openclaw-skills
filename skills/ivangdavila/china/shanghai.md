## Shanghai Strategy

- Cluster routes by district to avoid transit-heavy zig-zag days.
- Use one landmark evening, then move to neighborhood food zones.
- Book high-demand restaurants and rooftop bars ahead.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Staying only around top landmark strip pricing.
2. Treating all neighborhoods as same-cost and same-vibe.
3. Ignoring rain/air quality backup plans for skyline days.
