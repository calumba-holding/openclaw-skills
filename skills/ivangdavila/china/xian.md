# Xi'an Complete Guide

## City Pattern

### Ancient city wall and central core
**Vibe:** Historic axis, walkable old-city geometry.
**Best for:** First-day orientation and evening wall views.

### Muslim Quarter and nearby lanes
**Vibe:** Street-food density and high foot traffic.
**Best for:** Focused food windows, not full-day crowd exposure.

### Museum and heritage circuits
**Vibe:** Deep historical context and dynasty narrative.
**Best for:** Culture-heavy planning blocks.

## Xi'an Strategy

- Anchor one full day for Terracotta Army logistics with buffer.
- Keep one city-core day for food and wall routes.
- Manage crowd windows with early starts.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Combining Terracotta Army plus long night routing same day.
2. Underestimating queue and transfer times.
3. Treating Muslim Quarter as all-day-only destination.
