# Hainan Complete Guide

## Region Identity

China's tropical island route with beach and resort logic, but still highly sensitive to seasonality and domestic holiday demand.

## Base Strategy

### Sanya
- Resort-heavy with broad accommodation tiers.

### Haikou
- Better urban base with easier business-city rhythm.

### East coast pockets
- Lower-intensity options for longer relaxed stays.

## Route Rules

- Plan beach days around weather and sea conditions.
- Keep one city/indoor backup day for rain windows.
- Book peak-holiday inventory early.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming stable beach conditions every day.
2. Overpaying in top strips without value checks.
3. Ignoring seasonal storm patterns.
