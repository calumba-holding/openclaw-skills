# High-Altitude and Permit-Sensitive Areas

## Core Principle

Some routes require additional logistics, permissions, or altitude preparation. Confirm current requirements before fixed bookings.

## Planning Rules

- Verify permit/document needs for specific routes.
- Build acclimatization time at altitude.
- Keep contingency options for weather and health adaptation.

## Health and Safety Basics

- Ascend gradually where possible.
- Hydration and recovery pacing matter more than checklist speed.
- Escalate medical concerns early in remote zones.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Booking non-refundable chains before requirement checks.
2. Underestimating altitude impact.
3. Running tight, no-buffer highland schedules.
