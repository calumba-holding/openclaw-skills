# Great Ocean Road Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This route is scenic but often overcompressed. Better outcomes come from one overnight or structured pacing, not rushed same-day loops.

## Strategy

- Start early and avoid peak convoy windows where possible.
- Pair viewpoints by geography to cut backtracking.
- Keep one weather-alternate stop ready.

## Route Rules

- One-night route > same-day sprint for most travelers.
- Driving focus matters more than attraction count.
- Reserve key stays early in peak seasons.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating it as a casual add-on day from Melbourne.
2. Overstopping and losing safe daylight return margin.
3. Ignoring weather and road condition updates.
