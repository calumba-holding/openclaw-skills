# Transport Guide — Australia

## In Cities

- City transit is strong in major hubs, but coverage varies by suburb.
- Rideshare and taxis are useful for late-night and edge-area returns.
- District clustering reduces daily transfer friction.

## Intercity

### Domestic flights
- Best for major long-distance jumps.
- Add airport-transfer and delay buffers.

### Rail and coach
- Useful on selected corridors, often slower but lower stress.

### Car rental/campervan
- Best for region-focused routes where driving is part of trip design.
- Use daylight-focused planning in remote segments.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating long domestic transfers as full sightseeing days.
2. Tight connections with no disruption margin.
3. Night-driving remote routes without clear need.
