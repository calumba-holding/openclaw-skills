# Accommodation Guide — Australia

## Booking Strategy

1. Use fewer bases and 2+ nights where possible.
2. Prioritize neighborhood fit and transit/logistics access.
3. Book peak holiday windows and high-demand nature areas early.

## City Guidance

- **Sydney:** inner-city plus transport-linked beach access balance.
- **Melbourne:** CBD plus inner-neighborhood food access.
- **Brisbane/Gold Coast:** choose city-anchor vs beach-anchor early.
- **Perth/WA:** optimize for first and last drive day logistics.
