# Brisbane and Gold Coast Complete Guide

## Region Identity

Urban-river city plus high-energy beach corridor. Best results come from choosing one anchor and adding selective day moves.

## Brisbane

- Better for city comfort, food, and practical transport base.
- Good launch point for nearby nature day routes.

## Gold Coast

- Strong beach and surf identity with theme-park overlays.
- Better for resort-style and family-heavy itineraries.

## Strategy

- Avoid daily back-and-forth between Brisbane and southern beach zones.
- Build one city day, one coast day, one flexible weather day.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Underestimating corridor traffic patterns.
2. Overstacking theme-park and beach days.
3. Ignoring storm and surf condition updates.
