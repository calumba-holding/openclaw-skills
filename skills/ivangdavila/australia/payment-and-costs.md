# Payments and Cost Planning — Australia

## Cost Reality

Australia can be high-cost in major cities and remote regions. Planning quality comes from category-level budget realism, not generic daily estimates.

## Practical Setup

- Prepare at least two payment methods.
- Prebook high-demand segments early where price volatility is high.
- Keep transport and accommodation cost buffers for holiday windows.

## Budget Levers

- Fewer bases reduce transfer costs.
- Lunch and neighborhood dining improve food value.
- Shoulder periods often improve overall spend efficiency.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Underbudgeting domestic transfers.
2. Last-minute booking in peak corridors.
3. No contingency for weather-driven plan changes.
