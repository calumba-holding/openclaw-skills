# Perth and Western Australia Complete Guide

## Core Reality

WA offers huge value but enormous distances. Route quality depends on realistic transfer math and fuel-time planning.

## Perth

- Strong urban base with beaches and winery-day options.
- Best starting point for shorter WA introductions.

## WA Add-ons

- Margaret River corridor for wine and coast
- Coral Coast style routes for longer scenic drives
- Rottnest and nearby islands for compact add-ons

## Strategy

- Use Perth as anchor and avoid overreaching north/south in one short trip.
- Protect long-drive days with hard stop times.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating WA distances like east-coast distances.
2. Planning night driving in remote segments without need.
3. No fuel/time safety margin.
