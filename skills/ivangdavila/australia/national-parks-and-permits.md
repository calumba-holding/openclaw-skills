# National Parks and Permit Planning

## Core Principle

Access, closures, and permit requirements vary by park and season. Verify current conditions before fixed bookings.

## Planning Rules

- Check park alerts and closure notices before departure.
- Confirm permit/entry-pass requirements by park.
- Build weather and road-access contingency options.

## Practical Notes

- Peak season parking and entry windows can fill early.
- Some routes require stricter vehicle planning.
- Follow ranger guidance and posted restrictions.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming all parks have same rules and pass systems.
2. No backup plan for closures or fire/weather alerts.
3. Late arrival to high-demand entry zones.
