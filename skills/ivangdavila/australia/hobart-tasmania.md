# Hobart and Tasmania Complete Guide

## Region Identity

Tasmania is compact on map but slower in practice. Great for food and nature when itinerary pace is restrained.

## Base Strategy

### Hobart
- Best urban base for food and nearby nature day routes.

### Launceston or east-coast add-on
- Useful for longer loops with 2+ bases.

## Route Rules

- Keep 2-3 core stops max for 7-10 day windows.
- Weather and road conditions can shift quickly.
- Build one lower-intensity day per multi-drive block.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overstacking long scenic drives daily.
2. Ignoring weather buffers for hikes and coast stops.
3. Underestimating twilight/night driving risks on rural roads.
