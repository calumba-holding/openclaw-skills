# Wildlife and Outdoor Safety

## Core Principle

Wildlife encounters are part of Australia travel, but safety behavior should always be proactive, not reactive.

## Practical Rules

- Follow local signage for marine and land risks.
- Keep distance from wildlife and avoid feeding animals.
- Check local advisories for stingers, crocs, snakes, and surf conditions where relevant.

## Outdoor Safety Basics

- Carry water, sun protection, and communication backups.
- Avoid remote routes without clear route and return plan.
- Escalate early if conditions feel unsafe.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Ignoring local hazard signage.
2. Entering unfamiliar water without condition checks.
3. Underestimating heat and dehydration risk.
