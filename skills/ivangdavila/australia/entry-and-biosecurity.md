# Entry and Biosecurity Planning — Australia

## Core Principle

Entry requirements and biosecurity declarations matter. Confirm current rules before locking non-refundable itineraries.

## Planning Checklist

- Passport validity and entry eligibility
- Visa or eVisitor/ETA pathway by nationality
- Arrival declaration requirements
- Medication and restricted-item checks
- Proof of onward/return and insurance details

## Practical Rules

- Keep digital and offline copies of critical documents.
- Declare items when required; do not assume "small" items are exempt.
- Align itinerary commitments with confirmed entry status.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming older entry rules still apply.
2. Ignoring biosecurity declaration obligations.
3. Booking rigid domestic chains before entry is secure.
