# Nightlife Guide — Australia

## City Patterns

- **Sydney:** diverse zones with variable spend levels by district.
- **Melbourne:** laneway bars and music pockets with strong depth.
- **Brisbane/Gold Coast:** river-city and coastal-night mix.
- **Perth/Adelaide/Hobart:** smaller but high-quality concentrated circuits.

## Practical Rules

- Set return transport before final venue.
- Check city-specific lockout/entry patterns where relevant.
- Balance nightlife intensity with next-day transfer plans.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Staying only in highest-tourist nightlife strips.
2. No late-night transport backup.
3. Overstacking nightlife on transfer-heavy days.
