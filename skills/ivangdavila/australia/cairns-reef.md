# Cairns and Great Barrier Reef Complete Guide

## Core Reality

Reef quality depends on season, sea conditions, and operator choice. Plan by weather and marine conditions, not fixed social-media lists.

## Base Strategy

### Cairns city
- Best logistics base for reef tours and inland rainforest routes.

### Port Douglas
- Slower pace and higher-end stay profile.

### Daintree add-on
- Great for nature days with road and weather planning.

## Route Rules

- Keep one contingency day for marine weather changes.
- Choose fewer high-quality reef trips over multiple rushed bookings.
- Protect sun and hydration management.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Booking non-flex reef days with no weather backup.
2. Overcommitting to back-to-back full marine days.
3. Ignoring stinger-season and safety guidance.
