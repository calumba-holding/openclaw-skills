# Beaches and Coastal Stops — Australia

## Core Coastal Options

- **Sydney/NSW beaches:** easy urban-coast integration
- **Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast:** high-service beach corridors
- **WA coast segments:** dramatic scenery with distance overhead
- **Tasmania and southern coasts:** weather-variable but high scenic value

## Tropical and Reef Coast

- North Queensland routes require marine-weather awareness.
- Stinger-season and surf safety conditions should drive day planning.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning beach-only days with no weather backup.
2. Ignoring surf and marine condition updates.
3. Long detours for short stops with low route payoff.
