# Seasonality and Climate Strategy — Australia

## Core Reality

Australia climate is regionally diverse and opposite to northern-hemisphere assumptions.

## Seasonal Patterns

- **Summer:** strong beach demand, heat and storm risk in some regions.
- **Autumn:** often best all-round value and comfort windows.
- **Winter:** excellent for many northern and city routes.
- **Spring:** balanced shoulder period with variable regional weather.

## Planning Rule

Route by climate compatibility and regional weather windows, not fixed national assumptions.
Add one buffer day for every major weather-sensitive block.
