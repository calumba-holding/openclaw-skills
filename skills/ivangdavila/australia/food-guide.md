# Australia Food Guide

## Regional Food Pattern

| Region | Core Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| Sydney/NSW | Global-city dining with strong seafood and modern Australian mix |
| Melbourne/VIC | Cafe culture and high-density neighborhood dining |
| Queensland | Tropical produce, seafood, and relaxed coastal formats |

## Dining Rules

- Reserve top-demand dinners early, especially Thu-Sun.
- Use lunch for better value in premium areas.
- One block away from major waterfront strips often improves quality-price ratio.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Eating every meal in top tourist strips.
2. Queue-chasing with no quality signal checks.
3. Overbooking heavy tasting days without pacing.
