# Australia with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Sydney | Strong activity mix and transport flexibility |
| Melbourne | Family-friendly museums, parks, and neighborhoods |
| Gold Coast | Beach plus attractions with broad accommodation |
| Cairns | Nature and reef options with paced planning |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity per day plus downtime.
- Build heat, rain, and indoor backups into daily plans.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overloading long transfer-heavy days.
2. Ignoring sun and hydration planning.
3. Choosing accommodation too far from daily routes.
