# Adelaide and South Australia Complete Guide

## Region Identity

Low-friction city base plus wine and coastal routes. Excellent value when paced around fewer, deeper day segments.

## Adelaide

- Compact city with strong food and festival identity.
- Easy launch point for nearby wine and coast days.

## SA Add-ons

- Barossa/McLaren Vale style wine routes
- Kangaroo Island style nature segments (logistics heavy)
- Flinders Ranges and outback gateways for longer trips

## Strategy

- Choose one wine corridor per day, not multiple.
- Keep driving and tasting days separated by clear safety logic.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overpacking wine regions in one day.
2. Underestimating island/outback transfer overhead.
3. No buffer for weather-driven plan changes.
