# Long-Distance and Road-Trip Patterns — Australia

## Rule Zero

Australia road plans fail when distance math is optimistic. Build routes by safe daily drive windows, not just map lines.

## Proven Patterns

### Southeast loop
Melbourne -> Great Ocean Road -> return via inland or coastal sequence.

### WA branch
Perth -> southwest wine/coast corridor -> return.

### Outback-focused block
Alice Springs/Yulara with strict heat and fuel planning.

## Buffer Logic

- Add one low-intensity block every 3-4 drive-heavy days.
- Keep daylight-arrival targets in remote regions.
- Always carry fuel/time/weather margin.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Night-driving remote roads without necessity.
2. No slack for closures or weather changes.
3. Treating all roads as same-speed corridors.
