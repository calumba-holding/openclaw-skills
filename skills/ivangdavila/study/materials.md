# Study Materials Reference

## Material Types

### Textbooks & Chapters
- Dense, comprehensive, often overwhelming
- **AI role:** Summarize sections, explain jargon, answer "why" questions
- **Strategy:** Don't read linearly — survey first, then targeted reading

### Lecture Notes
- Fragmented, cryptic shorthand, gaps
- **AI role:** Fill gaps, clarify abbreviations, connect to textbook
- **Strategy:** Review within 24h while memory fresh

### Slides & Presentations
- Skeleton outlines, missing context
- **AI role:** Add context, explain transitions, generate speaker notes
- **Strategy:** Never study slides alone — supplement with notes/textbook

### Diagrams & Visual Aids
- Implicit logic, relationships shown not explained
- **AI role:** Describe what's happening, explain relationships
- **Strategy:** Can you redraw it from memory?

### Past Exams
- Gold standard for exam prep

## Creating vs Consuming

**Creating (High Learning Value):**
- Forces retrieval and synthesis
- Reveals gaps immediately
- The struggle IS the learning

**Consuming (Low Learning Value):**
- Illusion of understanding
- No feedback on comprehension
- Easy to skim without encoding

**Rule:** AI generates what TESTS knowledge. Student creates what BUILDS knowledge.

| AI Should Generate | Student Should Create |
