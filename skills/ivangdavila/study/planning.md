# Time Management Reference

## Semester Planning
- Extract ALL deadlines from syllabi day 1
- Identify exam clusters ("hell weeks")
- Allocate hours/week per subject by credit weight
- Schedule recovery periods

## Weekly Planning
- Fixed time blocks for each subject
- Match energy to difficulty (hard subjects → peak hours)
- Spread subjects across week (don't block-study)
- Weekly review: 30min Sunday to adjust

## Daily Sessions
- Pomodoro: 25-50min focused + breaks
- Same time, same place (habit formation)
- Batch similar tasks
- Hard end times prevent burnout

## Balancing Multiple Subjects
- Minimum viable attention: every subject 2-3x/week
- Priority rotation based on urgency
- Recognize when one subject is neglected

## Deadline Management
- Reverse scheduling: due date → subtract → start date
- Chunk large projects into mini-deadlines
- Buffer before deadline (never finish day-of)
- Submit early to avoid tech failures

## Buffer Time
- Only schedule 80% of available time
- 2-3 flex hours/week with no plan
- Know what to skip if sick
- Protected non-study time
