# Study Techniques Reference

## Pomodoro Technique
- 25min focus + 5min break
- After 4 cycles: 15-30min long break
- **Best for:** Procrastination-prone, long sessions, repetitive tasks
- **AI enforces:** Timer boundaries, break reminders

## Cornell Note-Taking
- Divide page: main notes | cues | summary
- During lecture: main notes
- After: add cues (questions, keywords)
- End: write summary from memory
- **Best for:** Lectures, dense reading
- **AI enforces:** Summary generation at session end

## Feynman Technique
1. Study the concept
2. Explain it simply (as if to a child)
3. Identify gaps in explanation
4. Go back and re-study gaps
- **Best for:** Deep understanding, complex topics
- **AI enforces:** "Explain this back to me" prompts

## SQ3R Method

- **Q**uestion: Turn headings into questions
- **R**ead: Read for answers
- **R**ecite: Answer questions without looking
- **R**eview: Check answers

## Active Recall
- Test yourself instead of re-reading
- Flashcards, practice questions, blank page recall
- **Best for:** Memorization, facts, formulas
- **AI enforces:** Quiz generation, spaced repetition

## Mind Mapping
- Central concept → branches → sub-branches
- Visual connections between ideas
- **Best for:** Brainstorming, seeing relationships
- **AI suggests:** When studying interconnected topics
