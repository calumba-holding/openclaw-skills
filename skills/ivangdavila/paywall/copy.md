## Benefit Copy

### Feature → Benefit Translation

| Feature | Benefit |

| No ads | Distraction-free experience |
| Priority support | Get help when you need it |
| Offline mode | Use anywhere, no wifi needed |
| Advanced analytics | See what's working |
| Team sharing | Collaborate seamlessly |

### Benefit Writing Rules
1. Start with the user outcome
2. Be specific (numbers > vague claims)
3. Address the implied objection
4. Keep each benefit to one line

### Strong Benefit Examples
- ✓ "Export in 4K—your videos deserve it"
- ✓ "No limits. Create as much as you want."
- ✓ "Reply in minutes, not days"

### Weak Benefit Examples
- ✗ "Premium features"
- ✗ "Better experience"
- ✗ "More options"

## Copy by Paywall Type

### Onboarding Paywall
- Focus on full value proposition
- List all premium benefits
- Emphasize trial (low risk)

Example:
```
Unlock Pro
✓ Unlimited exports
✓ All premium filters
✓ No watermarks
✓ Priority support

Start your 7-day free trial
Then $9.99/month. Cancel anytime.
```

### Contextual Paywall
- Focus on specific feature they wanted
- Show preview of what they'll get
- Shorter copy (they're mid-task)

Example:
```
This filter is Pro-only

Upgrade to use 200+ premium filters
and remove the watermark.

[Upgrade to Pro - $9.99/mo]
```

### Win-Back Paywall
- Acknowledge they left
- Offer incentive to return
- Show what's new

Example:
```
We've missed you!

Come back and get 50% off your first month.
Plus, check out our new features:
✓ [New feature 1]
✓ [New feature 2]

[Reactivate at 50% off]
```

## Localization Notes

### Region-Specific Patterns
- **US/EU:** Direct, feature-focused
- **LATAM:** Monthly price anchoring ("just $X.XX/month")
- **Asia:** Social proof, user counts

### Avoid in All Regions
- Slang that doesn't translate
- Idioms
- Humor that requires cultural context

### Numbers
- Use local currency symbol
- Consider local number formatting (1,000 vs 1.000)

## A/B Testing Copy

### High-Impact Tests
1. Headline (outcome vs feature focus)
2. Benefit framing (what you get vs what you avoid)
3. CTA text (trial vs purchase language)
4. Trust signals (which ones, where placed)

### Copy Test Tips
- Test one element at a time
- Headline tests move the needle most
- Small copy changes rarely have big impact
- Test meaning, not just words
