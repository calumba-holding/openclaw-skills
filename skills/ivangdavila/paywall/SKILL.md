## Triggers

Activate on: "create paywall", "subscription screen", "pricing page", "improve conversion", "paywall not converting", "free trial flow".

## Platform Differences

| Aspect | Mobile (iOS/Android) | Web (SaaS) |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| Context | Full-screen takeover | Pricing page or modal |
| Timing | Onboarding, contextual, campaigns | Landing page, upgrade prompts |
| Billing | App Store / Play Store | Stripe, Paddle, etc. |
| Trials | Store-managed | Self-managed |
| Testing | Remote config, A/B tools | Standard web A/B |

See `mobile.md` for iOS/Android specifics. See `web.md` for SaaS pricing pages.

## Placement Strategy

| Type | When | Conversion share |
|------|------|------------------|
| Onboarding | After install, during setup | 40-60% of trials |
| Contextual | User hits premium feature | 20-30% |
| Upgrade button | Persistent in UI | 10-20% |
| Campaign | Push, email, in-app trigger | 5-15% |

**Rule:** Always have an onboarding paywall. Most conversions happen when motivation is highest.

See `placement.md` for timing and trigger strategies.

## Core Layout Elements

Every high-converting paywall includes:

1. **Value proposition** — What they get (benefits, not features)
2. **Plan options** — Usually 2-3, with one highlighted
3. **Price display** — Clear, with anchoring if applicable
4. **CTA** — Single action, prominent
5. **Trust signals** — Trial terms, cancel anytime, reviews

See `layout.md` for design patterns and examples.

## Pricing Display

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Monthly equivalent | "Just $4.99/mo" for yearly |
| Savings badge | "Save 50%" on annual |
| Decoy plan | Makes target plan look better |
| Price anchoring | Show "was $X" or compare to alternatives |

**Default selection matters.** Pre-select the plan you want users to buy.

See `pricing.md` for plan structures and psychology.

## Copy Rules

- **Benefits over features.** "Unlimited exports" → "Never hit a limit"
- **Specific outcomes.** "Save 4 hours/week" beats "Save time"
- **Risk reversal.** "Cancel anytime" near CTA
- **Social proof.** "Join 50,000+ subscribers"

See `copy.md` for formulas by paywall type.

## Testing Priority

Test in this order (highest impact first):

1. **Price points** — Test every 6-12 months minimum
2. **Plan presentation** — Which plan is default, how many shown
3. **Layout** — Full redesigns, section order
4. **Copy** — Headlines, benefit framing
5. **Timing** — When paywall appears

**Rule:** Always A/B test paywall changes. Even "obvious" improvements can backfire.

See `testing.md` for metrics, sample sizes, and experiment design.

## Red Flags

Stop and fix:
- No onboarding paywall → Add one
- Only monthly plan → Add annual option
- Cluttered with options → Simplify to 2-3 plans
- No trial/guarantee → Add risk reversal
- Can't test remotely → Implement remote config
