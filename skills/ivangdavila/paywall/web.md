## Plan Card Anatomy

Each plan card should include:

1. **Plan name** — Free, Pro, Business, Enterprise
2. **Price** — Monthly/annual toggle above cards
3. **Billing period** — "/month" or "/user/month"
4. **Primary CTA** — "Start free trial", "Get started"
5. **Feature list** — 5-8 key features
6. **Highlight** — "Most popular" badge on recommended plan

## How Many Plans?

| # Plans | When |
|---------|------|
| 2 | Simple product, clear free/paid split |
| 3 | Most common. Free → Pro → Business |
| 4 | Enterprise segment + self-serve |
| 5+ | Usually too many. Confuses users. |

**Decoy effect:** The middle plan often converts best when framed between budget and premium options.

---

## Monthly vs Annual Toggle

### Display Options
- Toggle switch (most common)
- Tabs
- Radio buttons

### Annual Discount
Standard: 15-20% off monthly equivalent
Aggressive: 30-50% (often called "2 months free")

### Default Selection
**Always default to annual.** Higher LTV, lower churn.

Show monthly equivalent: "$29/mo billed annually" not just "$348/year"
