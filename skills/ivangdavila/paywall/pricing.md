# Paywall Pricing Strategy

## Plan Structures

### Two Plans
```
Free → Pro
```
- Simplest decision
- Clear upgrade path
- Works for single-feature products

### Three Plans (Most Common)
```
Free → Pro → Business/Team
```
- Good/better/best psychology
- Middle plan often converts best (decoy effect)
- Covers individual and team segments

### Four Plans
```
Free → Starter → Pro → Enterprise
```
- More price discrimination
- Risk: decision paralysis
- Only if segments are truly distinct

## Billing Periods

### Standard Options
| Period | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| Monthly | Low commitment, testing |
| Annual | Best LTV, lower churn |
| Lifetime | Controversial—use carefully |
| Weekly | High-frequency apps, aggressive |

### Annual vs Monthly Ratio
**Standard:** Annual = 10 months of monthly (17% discount)
**Aggressive:** Annual = 6-8 months of monthly (33-50% discount)

**Always show monthly equivalent** for annual plans:
- ✓ "$4.99/mo billed annually"
- ✗ "$59.88/year" (harder to process)

---

## Price Anchoring

### High-to-Low
Show expensive option first:
```
Enterprise $299 → Pro $49 → Free
```
Makes Pro seem reasonable.

### Versus Alternatives
"Less than your daily coffee"
"Cheaper than [competitor]"

### Savings Display
Show what they save with annual:
- "Save $60/year"
- "2 months free"
- "Save 33%"

---

## The Decoy Effect

Add a plan that makes your target plan look better:

**Without decoy:**
```
Monthly: $9.99
Annual: $59.99
```
Many choose monthly.

**With decoy:**
```
Monthly: $9.99
6-month: $54.99  ← Decoy (bad value)
Annual: $59.99   ← Now looks great
```

The decoy makes annual obviously better.

## Trial Strategy

### Trial Types
| Type | Mechanics |
|------|-----------|
| Free trial | Full access, then paywall |
| Freemium | Limited free tier forever |
| Metered | X free uses per period |
| Reverse trial | Start paid, keep free tier |

### Trial Length by Category
| Category | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Productivity | 7 days |
| Content/Media | 7-14 days |
| Fitness/Health | 14 days |
| B2B SaaS | 14-30 days |

### Trial Conversion Tactics
- Remind before trial ends (email, push)
- Show usage during trial ("You've saved 4 hours")
- Offer extension for engaged non-converters
- Ask why if they don't convert (feedback)

---

## Discount Strategy

### Discount Types
1. **Introductory offer** — First period discounted
2. **Win-back offer** — For churned users
3. **Exit offer** — When user tries to cancel
4. **Campaign offer** — Time-limited (Black Friday)

### When to Discount
- User hasn't converted after 30+ days
- User is about to churn
- Special occasions (test this—sometimes no discount wins)

### Discount Amount
- 20-30%: Standard promotional
- 40-50%: Aggressive/win-back
- 50%+: Only for special occasions

**Warning:** Frequent discounts train users to wait for deals.

## Regional Pricing

### Price Sensitivity by Region
| Region | Price sensitivity | Recommendation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| US | Low | Full price |
| EU | Medium | Full or slight discount |
| LATAM | High | 30-50% lower |
| SEA | High | 40-60% lower |
| India | Very high | 50-70% lower |

### Implementation
- Use purchasing power parity (PPP)
- Apple/Google have regional pricing tools
- Test before assuming (some markets surprise you)

### Localization Beyond Price
- Show local currency
- Use local payment methods
- Localize benefit copy (monthly anchoring works better in LATAM)

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Charm Pricing
- $9.99 vs $10 — works less than it used to
- $29 vs $30 — minimal difference
- For premium: round numbers can signal quality

### Price Endings
- .99: Budget-friendly signal
- .00: Premium, simple
- .95: Slightly less "salesy" than .99

### Price Presentation
**Do:**
- Show savings clearly
- Default to recommended plan
- Display monthly equivalent

**Don't:**
- Hide the price
- Use confusing per-seat math
- Change price on checkout

---

## Testing Pricing

### What to Test
1. **Price points** — Higher and lower than current
2. **Discount amounts** — Is 20% as effective as 30%?
3. **Trial length** — 7 vs 14 days
4. **Default plan** — Annual vs monthly pre-selected
5. **Display format** — Monthly equivalent vs total

### Metrics to Track
- **Conversion rate** — % who start trial/purchase
- **ARPU** — Average revenue per user
- **Trial-to-paid** — % of trials that convert
- **LTV** — Lifetime value (harder, but crucial)

### Testing Cadence
- Price tests: Every 6-12 months
- New markets: Test before assuming lower prices
- Major changes: A/B test, don't just ship
