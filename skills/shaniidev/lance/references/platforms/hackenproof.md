# HackenProof Reporting Guidance (Web3)

## Triage Focus

- technical root cause over narrative
- wallet/signature trust model correctness
- deterministic exploitability
- credible asset or authorization impact

## Mandatory Framing

- identify broken trust anchor
- explain protocol/SDK logic defect
- show downstream attack path (approval/permit/signature abuse)

## Frequent Downgrade Triggers

- framing issue as generic phishing without protocol bug
- missing persistence/session angle where relevant
- non-quantified impact claims
