# Bugcrowd Web3 Reporting Guidance

## Triage Focus

- business-impactful exploitability
- reproducible PoC steps
- severity mapping consistent with technical impact

## Required Detail Level

- deterministic exploit sequence
- prerequisites and constraints
- practical impact range

## Common Downgrade Triggers

- weak severity justification
- no economic feasibility for market attacks
- code smell reported as exploit
