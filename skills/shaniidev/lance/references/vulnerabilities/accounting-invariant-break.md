# Accounting Invariant Break

## Hunt Targets

- total assets vs total shares inconsistencies
- debt/collateral accounting drift
- mint/burn asymmetry
- reserve/supply mismatch

## Exploit Checks

- define invariant expected by protocol
- show deterministic sequence that violates invariant
- show resulting exploitable value transfer or lock

## Reject Conditions

- only transient, self-correcting drift with no exploit path
- no attacker leverage to extract value

## Evidence Required

- invariant formula
- before/after values showing break and impact
