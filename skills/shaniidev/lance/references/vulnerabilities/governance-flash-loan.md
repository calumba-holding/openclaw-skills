# Governance Flash-Loan Manipulation

## Hunt Targets

- snapshot-less voting logic
- governance weight derived from instantaneous balances
- proposal execution windows with weak anti-manipulation controls

## Exploit Checks

- prove temporary voting power can pass malicious proposal
- prove execution path is reachable under governance rules

## Reject Conditions

- robust snapshot/timelock/quorum protections
- insufficient liquidity or timing feasibility
- no consequential action post-vote

## Evidence Required

- vote-weight manipulation path
- proposal outcome and protocol impact
